Our\npowerhouse of products — including spending, saving, investing, exchanging,\ntravelling, and more — help our 65+ million customers get more from their\nmoney every day.\n\nAs we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ 2 things are essential to our\nsuccess: our people and our culture. In recognition of our outstanding\nemployee experience, we’ve been certified as a Great Place to Work™. So far,\nwe have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our offices and\nremotely, to help us achieve our mission. And we’re looking for more brilliant\npeople. People who love building great products, redefining success, and\nturning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful\nsolution.\nAbout the role\n\nThis role offers the opportunity to relocate to Poland, Spain, or the\nUAE.

Once you move, you’ll have the\nflexibility to work remotely or in a hybrid model from an office in Krakow,\nBarcelona, Madrid, or Dubai.\n\nOur Technology team builds the systems and experiences that keep Revolut\nmoving. From the infrastructure behind our innovative app to the features used\nby millions of people around the world, they bring sharp thinking, speed, and\na focus on meaningful impact to everything they do.\n\nYou may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial\nsystems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing\nhigh-quality code and building complex novel solutions end to end.\n\nThese geniuses created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop\nthere. They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality control in just a few\nweeks.\n\nUp for the challenge? Let’s get in touch.\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\nBuilding APIs, jobs and data pipelines, making sure they’re properly designed and scaled according to business needs\nWriting event consumers to build new data models to provide this data to new flows and processes\nWhat you’ll need\n\n5+ years of experience working as a software engineer\n3+ years of experience engineering with Python as your primary language\nAn academic background in a STEM subject\nFluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs\nExperience with API development and integration\nA practical understanding of distributed systems\nThe ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations\nExperience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting\nNice to have\n\nExperience with prototyping and sketching\nMultiple side projects or open source contributions\nExposure to GCP\n\nBuilding a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a\npriority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework,\ndesigned to help us thrive and grow everyday. We’re not just doing this\nbecause it’s the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that\nseeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to\ncreate exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s\nwhy we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and\nexperiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.",

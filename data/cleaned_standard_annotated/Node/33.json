  "text": "Senior Full-Stack / Founding Tech Lead (AI CRM)\nAbout us:\n\nWe’re building a modern, AI-first CRM for recruiting. True greenfield with\nrapid iterations and real ownership. Goal: MVP in ~60 days, harden for scale\nby Day 90. You’ll be the cornerstone engineering hire working directly with\nthe founder.\n\nWhy this role:\n\nMassive ownership: set the technical direction and standards from day one.\nReal product impact: ship AI features that recruiters use daily (search, summaries, matching, automations).\nFounding-level equity and a fast path to Head of Engineering / early CTO.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nOwn the architecture for a secure, multi-tenant SaaS, choosing a managed-first platform (e.g., Vercel/Cloudflare/Fly.io/Render or AWS/GCP/Azure) that balances speed, reliability, and cost for a small team.\nBuild end-to-end: TypeScript/React app, APIs, data models, background jobs, and real-time features.\nShip AI capabilities: RAG search, entity dedupe/matching, summarization, recommendations—designed with evals, guardrails, and cost/latency budgets.\nEstablish engineering standards: testing, code conventions, CI/CD, feature flags, observability, RBAC, audit trails, data privacy (consent/DNC, export/delete).\nCollaborate & lead: translate product goals into technical plans and help hire/mentor 3–6 engineers as we scale.\n\nWhat you’ll need (skills & experience):\n\n3++ years building and shipping SaaS with significant 0→1 ownership.\nStrong React + TypeScript and modern API design; comfortable with relational data modeling, transactions, and indexing.\nPractical LLM integration: embeddings/RAG, tool-calling/structured outputs, streaming UIs; you can weigh model quality vs. latency vs. cost.\nBackground processing: designing idempotent jobs, retries, schedules, and event-driven workflows.\nSecurity & privacy mindset: role-based access, least privilege, auditability, and basic threat modeling.\nProduct sense & communication: you can clarify scope, trade-offs, and deliver shippable increments quickly.\nTooling you’ll actually use (illustrative, or equivalent)\nWeb app & APIs: Next.js/React + TypeScript for UI and server routes; tRPC or REST/GraphQL for typed contracts.\nData: Postgres (Neon/Supabase/Cloud SQL/Aurora) + Prisma ORM; pgvector for semantic search; Redis (Upstash/managed Valkey) for cache/queues; object storage (S3/R2).\nAI: OpenAI / Anthropic / Google (plus OSS where it fits) via Vercel AI SDK/direct SDKs; LangGraph/LangChain/OpenAI Assistants for agentic flows where appropriate.\nPrompt Ops & evals: Langfuse (prompt/version registry & tracing),\nHelicone/Promptfoo/RAGAS/DeepEval for quality & cost metrics.\nBackground & orchestration: Inngest/Trigger.dev or Temporal; platform crons (Cloudflare/Vercel/EventBridge/Cloud Scheduler).\nObservability: OpenTelemetry traces + Sentry/Datadog/Grafana Cloud logs/dashboards.\nDelivery: GitHub Actions CI/CD, per-PR previews; GrowthBook/Unleash feature flags/A-B tests.\nAuth & enterprise: Auth.js/Clerk/Stytch for auth; WorkOS/Okta for SSO/SAML when needed.\nComms integrations: Resend/Postmark/Mailgun (email), Twilio/MessageBird (SMS), Google/Microsoft Graph (calendar).\nAI-accelerated dev: Cursor, Claude, Copilot/Cody—used deliberately with human-in-the-loop reviews.\n\nOutcomes that define success (30 / 60 / 90)\n\nDay 30\n\nArchitecture doc + lightweight threat model with platform choice rationale.\nMonorepo scaffold (Turborepo/pnpm, Biome/lint) + CI (GitHub Actions).\nAuth/roles live; first UI flows (companies/contacts); seeded Postgres/Prisma.\nBaseline AI: embeddings pipeline + eval harness wired into Langfuse; initial traces and cost/latency dashboard.\n\nDay 60 (MVP)\n\nUsable CRM: companies, contacts, pipeline, notes/tasks, saved views/search.\nEmail/SMS I/O and unified activity timeline; background jobs running in prod.\nAI V1: RAG search, dedupe/matching, meeting/email summaries; eval dashboards and budget guards.\n\nDay 90\n\nHardening: SLOs/alerts, audit logging, DR/backups (PITR), performance pass.\nFirst automations (auto-enrich → routing/sequences).\nPrompt versioning & A/Bs, red-team tests (injection/PII), model fallback/traffic splitting.\n\nNice to have\n\nCRM/ERP domain; deliverability and calendar integrations; analytics (PostHog/Segment).\nSOC2/GDPR exposure; incident response basics.\nTeam-lead experience (mentoring, hiring loop, leveling).\n\nCompensation & equity\n\nCompetitive salary + 5–10% founding-level equity\nMilestone bonuses tied to Day-60/90 deliverables.\nChange-of-control protection and refreshers at next financing.\n\nHow we work\n\nSmall, senior, high-trust team; short cycles, small diffs, preview-before-merge.\nAI-accelerated dev, measured by quality, safety, and cost—not just speed.\nSecurity by default and data privacy from day one.\n\nProcess:\nIntro chat → Systems/product deep-dive → Practical pairing or time-boxed take-\nhome (≤3 hours) → Founder loop → Offer.\n\nApply:\nSend GitHub/portfolio/LinkedIn and a short note on a 0→1 or LLM-powered\nfeature you shipped (what changed and why) to [[email protected]](/cdn-\ncgi/l/email-\nprotection#cba0aabfa3a7aeaea58baeafbcaab9afa1aaa8a4a9b8b9aea8b9bea2bfa6aea5bfe5a8a4a6e5aabe)\nwith Subject: Founding Full-Stack (AI CRM)",

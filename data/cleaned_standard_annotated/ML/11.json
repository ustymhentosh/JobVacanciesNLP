You will be responsible for designing, testing, and optimizing\nprompts for existing Large Language Models (LLMs) that process large\nvolumes of text and audio data. These models are used for summarization,\nprioritization, tone analysis, and extracting key information.\n\nThe role involves analyzing dataset outputs, identifying failure cases,\nrefining prompts , and quickly iterating based on internal feedback and\ntesting. Optionally, you may work with Python or PHP scripts to support\ndataset exploration and evaluation.\n\nWho We Are\n\nOur RnD department is a key driver of innovation in the company,\nconsisting of ten teams that develop CRM, marketing tools, CMS, payment\nsolutions, and internal systems. With a strong focus on automation,\nperformance, and scalability , we create solutions that enhance efficiency\nacross multiple business units.\n\nWhy Join Us?\n\nYou’ll work directly with LLM-powered systems that automate summarization, classification, and prioritization tasks across high-volume content flows.\nYou’ll be part of a process where prompt design directly impacts product output and user experience.\nYou’ll collaborate with a highly skilled RnD team — including developers, analysts, QA, DevOps, and product managers.\nWe promote experimentation, knowledge sharing , and give you the freedom to test new ideas and approaches.\nIf you enjoy working with AI tools and want to make them smarter and more reliable—this role is for you!\n\nRequirements\n\nMust-Have:\n\n1+ year of hands-on experience with LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude , or similar frameworks.\n2+ years of experience in a technical or analytical role (e.g. technical writer, analyst, QA, developer).\nUnderstanding of how GPT-style models behave and fail in real-world usage.\nExperience with SQL/PostgreSQL and data querying.\nAbility to read, build, and debug scripts on Python or PHP.\nStrong logical thinking and excellent written communication skills.\n\nNice-to-Have:\n\nCompleted a course or built a practical project in prompt design or LLM application.\nFamiliarity with prompt-based agents or RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) architectures.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nAnalyze business tasks and develop high-quality prompts for LLMs that handle summarization, prioritization, data extraction, and tone adjustment.\nWork with text and audio datasets, chunk datasets, test prompt variations and iterate based on results and team feedback.\nPerform data analysis at scale, optionally using Python scripts for support.\nCollaborate with developers, analysts, and product managers to deploy and evaluate LLM-based tools.\nResearch and document LLM behavior, limitations, and failure patterns to improve prompt strategies.\nEnsure prompt outputs are accurate, consistent, and aligned with project goals.\n\nBenefits\n\n18 business days of paid vacation \\+ public holidays compensation.\nInsurance Fund of the company.\nPartial coverage of all professional studies.\nCoverage of sick leaves, sports activities, and English language courses.",

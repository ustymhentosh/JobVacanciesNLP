  "text": "ML-engineer(Building human-like chat bot)\nOur experienced development team with over 10 years of expertise is looking\nfor an experienced Machine Learning Engineer. You will join a strong team\nof engineers, have a direct impact on product metrics, enjoy a high degree of\ndecision-making autonomy, and receive a competitive compensation package.\n\nRole & responsibilities\n\nDesign and develop human-like, action-level chatbots — dialog agents that not only converse naturally but also initiate and execute user workflows inside the product (data collection, process triggering, task completion).\nParticipate in the architecture and development of an intelligent, context-aware translation system that preserves meaning, tone, and style.\nLead experiments and deploy ML/NLP features into production with high stability and measurable results.\nWork with product and engineering teams to ensure fast, accurate, and reliable interaction between ML components and backend services.\nOwn the full ML feature lifecycle: data collection, experimentation, model training, deployment, monitoring, and quality improvement.\n\nMust-have requirements\n\n3+ years of experience with Python development and maintaining production-grade services.\nExperience in Web/API development (REST, versioning, logging, observability).\nStrong skills in Pandas, NumPy, and SQL for data processing and analysis.\n1+ year of hands-on experience solving real ML tasks (NLP/CV) within production projects.\nExperience with TensorFlow, Keras, and/or Hugging Face frameworks.\nUnderstanding of model deployment and monitoring practices.\nSolid knowledge of GIT, HTTP(s), JSON/XML, and basic networking protocols (TCP/IP).\nUnderstanding of SDLC fundamentals, code review, CI/CD pipelines.\nFamiliarity with LLM-based architectures (prompt engineering, RAG/fine-tuning, backend integration).\nExperience building intelligent chatbots that perform real actions in the product (not just FAQ or support bots).\n\nNice to have\n\nExperience with PyTorch, SciPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, LangChain or LlamaIndex.\nExperience with Docker, NoSQL or Vector Databases (e.g., Weaviate, PGVector, Milvus).\nBasic JavaScript knowledge for integrating ML services with the frontend.\nDiffusion-based image generation (e.g., Flux, LoRA, inference optimization) — optional, but a strong plus.\nAutomated LLM evaluation frameworks (offline/online harnesses, A/B testing).\nExperience working with multimodal models (text↔image, vision-language).\nHow we work\n\nEngineering rigor: measurability, reproducibility, degradation control.\nCollaborative architecture: decisions driven by data, not intuition.\nProduct focus: response time, accuracy, scenario conversion, and cost per task.\n\nWorking Conditions:\n\nRemote work in a friendly and comfortable team of professional developers WITHOUT the oppression of marketers;\nOn-time salary starting from $10000 gross;\n2 weeks paid holiday a year;\nPaid sick days;\nPaid time off on major Slavic holidays;\nOpportunity to attend professional courses at company’s expense;\nWorking week: Sunday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Israel time.\n\nWe would love to give you all the details about the position! Send your CV\nnow and we will contact you!\n\n!!! IMPORTANT TO KNOW !!!\n\nWe have a multinational development team, which was formed more than 9 years\nago. Our team includes people living in different CIS countries, so the\nlanguage of communication is russian. But the company and all our employees\nare strongly opposed to russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company provides\nhumanitarian aid to Ukraine and helps our employees living there.\n\nWe believe in the victory of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to ZSU! Glory\nto the Ukrainian nation!",

### **Who you’ll be working with:**

and who you’ll be working with every day — that’s why we’re sharing a brief
overview of our team ☺️  
[Our team

### **Why is this interesting?**

  * Join a fast-growing, **#1 product in its niche**

  * **Influence strategic product decisions** — we actively listen to our team, so your input will directly impact functionality, user experience, and the product’s future
  * **High level of autonomy** — we put a lot of trust in our team

### **Your responsibilities:**

You will play a key role in building and developing the **Mindly** product.
This is more than just writing code — it’s about deep user understanding,
product thinking, and effective collaboration with a cross-functional team.

You’ll work closely with the Engineering Team Lead, Product Design Lead, Data
Analyst, CEO, and other team members in order to:

  * deeply understand user needs and their most pressing problems
  * shape and evaluate potential solutions to these problems
  * collaborate with the designer to create design + engineering solutions and develop a clear implementation plan
  * implement these solutions into functional and reliable code, both on the frontend and backend.

You will become a true **“Product Engineer”** , someone who fully understands
code, design, the user, and the business. Working independently, you’ll drive
the entire development cycle: from identifying the problem to launching the
finished solution into production.

### **Your skills:**

  * 4+ years of experience working with React.js and Node.js (we’re using TypeScript, React.js, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js)
  * **Product thinking** focused on solving user problems, not just on technical solutions
  * Willingness and ability to quickly learn new tools, frameworks, and technologies on the job
  * Experience in mobile app development will be a huge plus
  * Ability to clearly formulate goals and tasks and present results

### **How we get things done?**

We are **remote-first** , but we also have offices in Ukraine and in Poland
(Warsaw), so you can mix and match if you prefer. Ideally, you should be in
the **CET or EET time zone**

### **How do we unwind?**

We offer our team 20 days of paid vacation and free therapy for you and your
partner. We’re also very flexible with days off :)

### **What do we offer?**

  * A **fast-growing product company** where you are a key part of our success
  * **Competitive salary**
  * A strong team of **A-players**

### **Candidate journey:**

  * Screening interview / Intro chat
  * Technical interview with Engineering Lead
  * Final interview with CEO&CMO
  * Offer 🎉

### **Our values:**

  * **Honesty and transparency:** always tell the truth, no matter what it is
  * **Empathy and understanding:** treat others the way you want to be treated

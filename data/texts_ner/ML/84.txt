We are [elai.io](http://elai.io/), an innovative AI-driven startup
specializing in video generation. Recently acquired by Panopto — a leader in
interactive video solutions — we’re now part of a growing team of around 200
professionals focused on advancing learning through powerful, interactive
video technology.

We are looking for a **Computer Vision Engineer** to join our team and
contribute to cutting-edge **projects in face emotion recognition and avatar
video generation**. In this role, you will design, develop, and optimize AI
models that power next-generation human-avatar interactions. You’ll
collaborate closely with researchers, engineers, and product teams to bring
innovative ideas into production, ensuring that our solutions are both
technically robust and deliver exceptional user experiences.

**Your responsibilities:**

  * Research & Innovate: Dive deep into the latest academic research to design and implement cutting-edge computer vision algorithms specifically for video generation.
  * Build & Train: Develop, train, and fine-tune sophisticated neural network models (e.g., GANs, Diffusion Models, Transformers, NeRFs) to achieve state-of-the-art results.
  * Analyze & Optimize: Define crucial quality metrics, run rigorous machine learning experiments, and perform in-depth analysis to continuously improve model performance.
  * Manage Data: Research, identify, and utilize appropriate large-scale datasets to train and validate your models.
  * Deploy & Ship: Write clean, robust, and efficient production code, and collaborate with the engineering team to deploy your models into our core product.
  * Knowledge Transfer & Documentation: Create detailed documentation for model architectures, experimental results, and production code. Conduct knowledge-sharing sessions to mentor and collaborate with the broader technical team.
  * Lead the Field: Be a thought leader on the team, staying on top of industry trends and proposing new technologies to keep us at the cutting edge.

**Required Qualifications:**

  * Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field
  * 4+ years of experience in machine learning or deep learning roles
  * Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow
  * Experience with computer vision, or generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs, diffusion models)
  * Strong understanding of model training, evaluation, and deployment pipelines.
  * Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

**We offer:**

  * Competitive salary based on qualifications and contributions
  * Paid vacation and sick leaves
  * Flexible working hours
  * Opportunity to work with a highly qualified international, friendly team

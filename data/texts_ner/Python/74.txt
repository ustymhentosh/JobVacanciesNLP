### About Revolut

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, and more
freedom. Since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. Our
powerhouse of products — including spending, saving, investing, exchanging,
travelling, and more — help our 65+ million customers get more from their
money every day.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ 2 things are essential to our
success: our people and our culture. In recognition of our outstanding
employee experience, we’ve been certified as a Great Place to Work™. So far,
we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our offices and
remotely, to help us achieve our mission. And we’re looking for more brilliant
people. People who love building great products, redefining success, and
turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful
solution.

### About the role

This role offers the opportunity to [relocate to Poland, Spain, or the
UAE](https://www.revolut.com/relocation-with-revolut/). You’ll receive support
from Revolut throughout the entire process. Once you move, you’ll have the
flexibility to work remotely or in a hybrid model from an office in Krakow,
Barcelona, Madrid, or Dubai.

Our Technology team builds the systems and experiences that keep Revolut
moving. From the infrastructure behind our innovative app to the features used
by millions of people around the world, they bring sharp thinking, speed, and
a focus on meaningful impact to everything they do.

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial
systems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing
high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end to end.

These geniuses created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop
there. They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality control in just a few
weeks.

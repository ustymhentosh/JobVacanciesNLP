Middle ML Engineer — AI Agents (Python)
Hello!

We are Harmix ([www.harmix.ai](http://www.harmix.ai)), a Ukrainian startup
that innovates long-horizon memory and multimodal search for AI agents. We are
launching the Proactive AI Manager. This workflow-driven operator anticipates
tasks and follows through end-to-end. Our research focuses on cross-modal
interpretation and knowledge representation in human-AI collaboration. Harmix
was featured at TechCrunch Disrupt and Collision.

We seek a **Middle ML Engineer** specializing in Generative AI to join our
innovative team. You’ll be at the forefront of developing multimodal AI, Large
Language Models (LLMs), and AI Agents.

**Key Responsibilities:**

  * Develop and optimize generative models using Python and PyTorch.
  * Implement and refine multimodal AI solutions integrating audio, text, and visual data.
  * Design and enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents for complex tasks.
  * Build robust ML pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment.
  * Collaborate closely with backend, frontend, and DevOps teams to ensure seamless integration of AI models.
  * Conduct experiments, analyze results, and continually improve model performance.
  * Document research findings, codebases, and model architectures clearly and effectively.

**What We Expect from the Candidate:**

  * Solid understanding of Machine Learning fundamentals, including deep learning, NLP, and generative models.
  * 3+ years of experience working with Python and PyTorch.

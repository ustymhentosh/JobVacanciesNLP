C# .NET Backend Developer (short-term)
### About the Project

The company builds real-time tracking, communication, and data analytics
systems for organizations operating in challenging or remote environments.

Their solutions combine:

  * **Hardware** (trackers & telemetry devices) — installed on aircraft, vehicles, boats, or worn by personnel to monitor movement and equipment status
  * **Cloud platform** — collects data from devices, displays it on maps, sends alerts, and helps managers make real-time decisions

### Why It Matters

  * In industries where every second counts — such as aerial firefighting — the system helps visualize exactly where aircraft are located, when they’re making water drops, etc.
  * The platform works even in remote or hard-to-reach areas where standard communication may be weak
  * It goes beyond simple “who’s where” tracking — it analyzes data, detects unusual behavior, alerts if a device stops transmitting, and provides analytics for future mission planning

**In short:** This solution helps companies and services know where their
people and equipment are, whether everything is operating normally, and
enables rapid response when something goes wrong. Their technology combines
devices + global connectivity + intelligent software to make remote or high-
risk operations safer and more efficient.

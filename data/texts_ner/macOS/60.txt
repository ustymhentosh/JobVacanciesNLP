distributes software for macOS and iOS. Today, we have 20 million active users
across all our products._

_At MacPaw, we believe humans and technology can reach their greatest
potential together._

We’re looking for a mature, independent, and proactive **macOS Engineer** to
join the team behind Eney, a brand-new product that’s just beginning its
journey.

[Eney](https://macpaw.com/eney) is an AI companion designed to help Mac users
stay organized, automate their routine tasks, and focus on what matters most.

We’re looking for someone who enjoys diving into complex and unfamiliar
problems, is skilled at reading and understanding other people’s code, and can
communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical teammates.

This is a unique opportunity to directly shape how the Eney character will
look and behave — creating a one-of-a-kind macOS experience with no real
analogs. Your ideas and expertise will have a tangible impact on the product’s
future, and you’ll also have the opportunity to drive key technical decisions.

If you’re excited about building something unique at the intersection of AI,
3D animation, and macOS, we’d love to hear from you!

### In this role, you will:

  * Add new animations to the current 3D character
  * Extend animation composer to let other team members experiment with animations independently
  * Collaborate closely with designers, product managers, and non-technical teammates to bring ideas to life and explain technical decisions clearly
  * Investigate, research, and prototype solutions for complex or unfamiliar technical challenges

### **Skills you’ll need to bring:**

  * Proven macOS/iOS development experience
  * Proficiency in Swift
  * Solid knowledge of computer science fundamentals
  * Experience with native 3D graphics frameworks (e.g., Metal, SceneKit)
  * Experience with 3rd-party 3D solutions and engines (e.g., Spline, Unity, Unreal)
  * Hands-on experience with real-time animation of 3D objects
  * Experience in shader programming (in any language)
  * Ability to understand, maintain, and build upon other developers’ custom solutions
  * Strong communication skills, ability to explain complex technical topics to non-technical colleagues
  * Ability for self-learning, investigation, and research
  * Intermediate (or higher) level of English for effective team communication

**As a plus:**

  * Objective-C knowledge
  * Experience with interprocess communication
  * Familiarity with CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Azure)
  * Experience developing or supporting custom graphics pipelines

### **What we offer:**

  * **We are a Ukrainian company, and we stand with Ukraine against the russian aggression**   
We maintain workplaces for the mobilized Macpawians and provide financial
support to colleagues or their families affected by the war.

up, lying down, and running around; a gym for recreation; cozy kitchens; a
sleeping/meditation room; and a terrace with a view where we throw summer

bring your pets to the office (we have separate floors for cats and dogs).

** Convenient personal time-off policy to help you take care of essential
matters in your personal life, and parental leaves. On top of all that,
sabbaticals are open after 5 years of being with MacPaw.

across many fields, and you are welcome to jump in to make the world a better

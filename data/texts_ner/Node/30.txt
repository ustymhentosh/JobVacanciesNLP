  * Keep our codebase clean through thoughtful code reviews, clear documentation, and solid engineering practices.
  * Join in on system planning, find ways to improve how we work, and contribute to broader company goals.
  * Mentor junior engineers, give constructive feedback, and share your knowledge on design and best practices.

This role focuses on taking technical ownership of critical voice
infrastructure and helping shape its evolution.

### **Role Overview**

We’re looking for an experienced engineer to work on the core voice platform,
ensure its reliability, and drive its technical growth.

You’ll work on real-time systems with strict performance requirements,
collaborate closely with the engineering team, and become a key point of
expertise for voice and streaming infrastructure.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Take ownership of existing voice and telephony systems, including:  
  

    * Real-time TTS and STT streaming  
  

    * Inbound and outbound programmable call handling  
  

    * Browser widget integrations for voice calls  
  

  * Improve and extend backend services for performance, scalability, and maintainability.  
  

  * Implement new voice-related features end to end, from signaling to audio delivery.  
  

  * Ensure production systems are stable, observable, and well-documented.  
  

  * Act as a technical counterpart for other teams when issues or new requirements arise.  
  

  * Contribute to architectural decisions and long-term infrastructure direction.  
  

### **Requirements**

  * 5+ years of backend development experience with strong Node.js skills.  
  

  * Proficiency with NestJS, Next.js, and React.  
  

  * Experience with Prisma ORM and Redis for caching and real-time data.  
  

  * Solid understanding of real-time systems and event-driven architectures.  
  

  * Strong knowledge of telephony protocols, including:  
  

    * SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for signaling  
  

    * RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) for audio streaming  
  

    * Familiarity with SDP negotiation, NAT traversal, and media routing  
  

  * Experience working with VoIP or telephony platforms (e.g., Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, Kamailio, Twilio, or similar).  
  

  * Familiarity with TTS/STT streaming and audio processing pipelines.  
  

  * Ability to quickly understand and work with complex existing systems.  
  

  * Proactive and reliable — takes ownership and solves problems effectively.  
  

  * Clear communication skills for collaborating with distributed teams.  
  

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience with WebRTC, ICE/STUN/TURN, or real-time browser communication.  
  

  * Knowledge of audio codecs (Opus, G.711, G.729) and media handling.  
  

  * Background in SIP trunking, call routing, or SBCs (Session Border Controllers).  
  

  * DevOps skills (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring, load testing).  
  

  * Experience building scalable, low-latency voice infrastructure in production.  
  

### **Why Join**

This is a high-impact engineering role working on technically demanding real-
time systems at the heart of our Ai products.

You’ll have meaningful ownership, real responsibility, and the opportunity to
work deeply with modern telephony technologies, real-time streaming, and AI
voice pipelines.

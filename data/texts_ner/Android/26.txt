Junior Android Engineer
**Who are we, and what do we aspire to?**

Liven builds an ecosystem of products that help people understand themselves
better, manage their thoughts, and, as a result, feel better.

We believe that self-discovery is a lifelong journey and want to help people
navigate it every step of the way. That’s why Liven is building a system of
tools to help people compose themselves and grow into who they want to become.

People use Liven to track their mood, process emotions, and untangle thoughts
by chatting with an AI companion. They build new routines with a task planner,
explore how their brain and body react to trauma through personalized courses,
take well-being quizzes, and relax or refocus with soundscapes.

Our goal is to become the No.1 brand in the wellbeing category.

We aim to earn global trust by building an ecosystem of context-aware products
for self-care and improvement. Our brand is optimistic and whimsical, yet wise
and practical. We’re Liven! We bring joy back to life!

**You will:**

— Develop key AI features in the mobile app — integrating them into the main
user flows, working with AI APIs, and building an intuitive UX around the
assistant;  
— Participate in the design of new feature architectures — with a focus on
scalability, component reusability, and performance;  
— Take full ownership of feature delivery: from idea, UI/UX discussions, and
technical design to stable production release and monitoring;  
— Work with CI/CD, analytics, and feedback loops — not just “implementing,”
but continuously improving features based on data;  
— Collaborate with AI, product, and design teams — joining forces to create an
intelligent, adaptive mobile experience;  
— Proactive involvement in improving engineering practices, development
approaches, app performance, and overall quality culture.

### What’s important to us:

— 1+ year of Android development experience;  
— Strong knowledge of Kotlin and Android SDK, understanding their capabilities
and limitations;  
— Experience working with Jetpack Compose in production apps;  
— Understanding of architectural approaches: MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture;  
— Experience delivering features end-to-end: implementation, release,
monitoring, and iteration;  
— Experience integrating analytics, tracking metrics, and ensuring
observability of mobile functionality;  
— Understanding of Android component lifecycles, threading, and asynchronous
logic;  
— Experience with REST/GraphQL APIs, WebSocket, Retrofit/Ktor, Apollo,
navigation, and dependency injection (Koin) — familiarity with at least some
of these is expected (not all);  
— Bonus: practical experience writing Unit, integration, and E2E tests;  
— Proactivity, independence, and the desire to influence the product rather
than just “close tasks.”

### You’re definitely a great fit if you:

— Want to directly influence the technologies and architecture of the product
from day one (and even before that!);  
— Are ready to own a feature from idea to delivery and user monitoring;  
— Can confidently defend your point of view and make independent decisions;  
— Aren’t afraid of a fast-paced environment and a high number of experiments;  
— Know how to balance between technology, user needs, and business goals;  
— Are open to feedback and eager for rapid professional growth and self-
development.

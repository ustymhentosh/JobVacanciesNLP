Senior Java Software Engineer
**Help build smarter tools for purchasing & supply chain**

We’re looking for an experienced **Backend Engineer** to join a growing
product team working on a complex purchasing and supply chain system. If you
enjoy solving real-world business problems, working with modern Java tech, and
collaborating with a friendly, experienced team, we’d love to hear from you.

**Who we’re looking for**

**Must-haves:**

  * 7+ years of experience working with Java (Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate)
  * Strong understanding of software fundamentals — data structures, algorithms, clean code, etc.
  * Solid knowledge of distributed systems, networking, and UNIX/Linux environments
  * Solid understanding of microservices architecture and RESTful API design
  * **Advanced SQL skills** — you should be comfortable writing, reading, and optimizing raw SQL
  * Deep knowledge of **Java concurrency** with a focus on performance optimization
  * Strong experience working with Java specifications, especially **JPA**
  * Experience designing and tuning relational databases
  * Familiarity with NoSQL databases
  * Comfortable with Docker and/or Kubernetes
  * Confident in writing unit tests and debugging complex problems
  * Analytical mindset and great attention to detail

**What you’ll be doing**

  * Building fast, reliable, and scalable backend services using Java and Spring/Spring Boot
  * Designing and developing APIs that support frontend apps and business logic
  * Working closely with product, frontend, and infrastructure teams to plan and build new features
  * Writing and optimizing complex **SQL queries** — we use a lot of **pure SQL** , so strong database skills are essential.
  * Investigating 3rd-party tools (for data, performance, security) and helping choose the right ones
  * Troubleshooting tricky issues and improving system performance
  * Documenting how things work (flow diagrams, use cases, etc.)
  * Participating in code reviews and knowledge sharing

**About the project**

The team is building a modern, data-driven platform for streamlining
purchasing and supply chain processes. It’s a long-term product development
effort — not an outsourcing gig — with lots of ownership, smart engineering
decisions, and space for meaningful technical input.

You’ll be joining a supportive, cross-functional team that values quality,
collaboration, and transparency.

**Location:** Remote, across the EU

**Type:** Full-time

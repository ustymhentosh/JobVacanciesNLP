Platform Backend Engineer
**Are you ready to take ownership of our platform engineering?**

As a Platform Back-end Engineer, you’ll be part of a small but impactful team
responsible for the company’s core platform. From player session management
and game deployment pipelines to integrations with operators and regulatory
bodies, the platform is the foundation on which everything runs. You’ll get to
work closely with the Tech Lead, Chief Architect, and other engineers, writing
clean, scalable code and contributing to architectural decisions.

**All you need is:**

  * 3+ years of experience in backend development, ideally on platform or systems-level projects;
  * Strong experience with at least one Backend/Systems Language (Java, C++, Rust, C#, GO);
  * Good understanding of microservices, distributed systems, and event-driven architectures;
  * Hands-on experience with NoSQL databases and scaling database-driven applications;
  * Familiarity with AWS infrastructure and cloud-based deployments;
  * Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail;
  * Excellent communication skills and a collaborative mindset;
  * A proactive, hands-on approach — you’re as comfortable digging into code as you are discussing solutions.

**Summary of Responsibilities:**

  * Designing, building, and maintaining platform services with a focus on performance, scalability, and security;
  * Developing new features and improving existing ones across the core platform;
  * Supporting integrations with operators, aggregators, and regulators;
  * Writing clean, tested, and maintainable code in line with best practices;
  * Troubleshooting and optimising systems for reliability and speed;
  * Contributing to architectural discussions and suggesting improvements;
  * Collaborating with other engineers, QA, and Product to deliver on roadmap goals;
  * Helping reduce technical debt and modernise legacy code when necessary.

**Tech Stack:**

The team is modernising the platform, and you’ll get to work with:

  * Backend: Java, Typescript, NodeJS, Python;
  * Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, CloudFront, Route53), Linux, Docker;
  * Databases: MongoDB;
  * Monitoring & CI/CD: Github, Jenkins, TerraForm, CAdvisor, Prometheus, Grafana.

**Why you will love working here:**

  * A remote-first culture built on trust, flexibility, and respect;
  * An ambitious, transparent leadership team that actually listens;
  * Plenty of autonomy and the opportunity to make a big, meaningful impact;
  * A product you can influence at the deepest level;
  * Competitive salary, holiday, and benefits (tailored depending on location).

**And this is how our interview process goes:**

  * A 30-minute interview with a Recruiter to get to know you and your experience;
  * A technical interview to assess your skills and abilities;
  * A final 1-hour interview with three team members to gauge your fit with company culture and working style.

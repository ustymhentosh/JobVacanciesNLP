      "Generative AI & Creative Systems Specialist\nAs a Generative AI & Creative Systems Specialist, you will design,\norchestrate, and continuously improve AI-based creative workflows for\nimages, video, and text elements that power MGID’s automated creative\ngeneration ecosystem — including tools used directly by clients within the\nplatform.\n\nYour mission is to turn creative vision into structured, scalable systems\nthat consistently deliver high-quality, compliant, and performance-ready\noutputs — not just one-off manual results.\n\nYou’ll work closely with the R &D Creative Team (AI Expert, Creative\nDesigner, Creative Manager, and Team Lead) to ensure AI-generated content\naligns with campaign goals, brand identity, and compliance standards. You will\nbridge creative intent and technical implementation , shaping how AI\nsupports every stage of the creative process.\n\n What You’ll Do\n\n Design and maintain scalable AI workflows for image, video, and text generation within MGID’s creative ecosystem.\n Develop prompt architectures and orchestration logic that connect multiple AI agents (e.g., image generation, title generation, creative scoring).\n Use n8n to build and automate creative workflows , helping test AI outputs faster, organize prompt experiments, and reduce repetitive manual steps during generation or review.\n Experiment with and refine prompt strategies , model setups , and multi-model combinations to achieve stable, category-relevant outputs.\n Select and evaluate AI models (text, image, video) for each use case, balancing quality, latency, and cost.\n Apply or adapt fine-tuned or LoRA-based models to improve realism, style consistency, or brand fidelity.\n Review generation outputs for usability, compliance, and safety (e.g., readability, NSFW filtering, brand adherence).\n Build reusable prompt templates, patterns, and creative logic to accelerate iteration and maintain consistent quality.\n Collaborate with backend developers to define API prompt structures , input-output formats, and system prompt hierarchies for integration into MGID’s creative tools.\n Occasionally prototype lightweight utilities or scripts (e.g., Colab flows, Python snippets, Chrome extensions) to validate new generation flows before full implementation.\n Document workflows clearly and communicate decisions to both technical and creative peers.\n\n Who You Are\n\n You have hands-on experience working with AI-driven creative workflows (typically 2+ years, or proven real-world portfolio).\n You understand prompt design across text, image, and video — including image-to-image, control flows, or text-to-video techniques.\n You think in systems and dependencies , building repeatable creative flows rather than isolated outputs.\n You are familiar with fine-tuning concepts, dataset preparation, and LoRA adaptations , and can work with or adjust existing models when needed.\n You have experience with Stable Diffusion / SDXL, Flux, Kling, Minimax, Runway, OpenAI , or similar multimodal systems.\n You can analyze and explain model behavior, quality trade-offs, and best-fit scenarios for each creative task.\n You are comfortable collaborating with both creative and technical teams , translating between design goals and system logic.\n You can explain how and why a specific AI setup achieves the desired result — and iterate effectively when it doesn’t.\n You are proactive, organized, and thrive in a fast-paced, experimental R&D environment.\n Your English is Intermediate+ , sufficient for documentation and cross-team communication.\n\n Nice to have\n\n Experience working with APIs , Python scripting , or automation tools (e.g., n8n, Colab).\n Familiarity with SQL queries and basic database structures (e.g., understanding how creative data or generation logs are stored and accessed).\n Experience working in AdTech or MarTech environments.\n Basic knowledge of HTML and front-end data handling principles.\n Familiar with Cursor , Claude Code , or similar AI-assisted development tools for creating internal utilities, workflow prototypes, or lightweight automation apps.\n Understanding of prompt orchestration frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom agent pipelines).\n\n Why Join MGID\n\nIf you want to help shape how thousands of brands generate ad visuals and\ncopy at scale — building AI systems that transform creativity into\nstructured, repeatable excellence — this is your opportunity.\n\nJoin a team that merges technology, creativity, and responsibility to\nredefine what advertising looks like in the AI era.\n\nApply now and help power the next generation of intelligent, scalable, and\ntruly creative AI solutions.",

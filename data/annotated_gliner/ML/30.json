      "Senior Full-Stack / Founding Tech Lead (AI CRM)\nAbout us:\n\nWe’re building a modern, AI-first CRM for recruiting. True greenfield with\nrapid iterations and real ownership. Goal: MVP in ~60 days, harden for scale\nby Day 90. You’ll be the cornerstone engineering hire working directly with\nthe founder.\n\nWhy this role:\n\n Massive ownership: set the technical direction and standards from day one.\n Real product impact: ship AI features that recruiters use daily (search, summaries, matching, automations).\n Founding-level equity and a fast path to Head of Engineering / early CTO.\n\n \nWhat you’ll do:\n\n Own the architecture for a secure, multi-tenant SaaS, choosing a managed-first platform (e.g., Vercel/Cloudflare/[Fly.io/Render](http://Fly.io/Render) or AWS/GCP/Azure) that balances speed, reliability, and cost for a small team.\n Build end-to-end: TypeScript/React app, APIs, data models, background jobs, and real-time features.\n Ship AI capabilities: RAG search, entity dedupe/matching, summarization, recommendations—designed with evals, guardrails, and cost/latency budgets.\n Establish engineering standards: testing, code conventions, CI/CD, feature flags, observability, RBAC, audit trails, data privacy (consent/DNC, export/delete).\n Collaborate & lead: translate product goals into technical plans and help hire/mentor 3–6 engineers as we scale.\n\n \nWhat you’ll need (skills & experience):\n\n 3++ years building and shipping SaaS with significant 0→1 ownership.\n Strong React + TypeScript and modern API design; comfortable with relational data modeling, transactions, and indexing.\n Practical LLM integration: embeddings/RAG, tool-calling/structured outputs, streaming UIs; you can weigh model quality vs. latency vs. cost.\n Background processing: designing idempotent jobs, retries, schedules, and event-driven workflows.\n Security & privacy mindset: role-based access, least privilege, auditability, and basic threat modeling.\n Product sense & communication: you can clarify scope, trade-offs, and deliver shippable increments quickly.\n Tooling you’ll actually use (illustrative, or equivalent)\n Web app & APIs: Next.js/React + TypeScript for UI and server routes; tRPC or REST/GraphQL for typed contracts.\n Data: Postgres (Neon/Supabase/Cloud SQL/Aurora) + Prisma ORM; pgvector for semantic search; Redis (Upstash/managed Valkey) for cache/queues; object storage (S3/R2).\n AI: OpenAI / Anthropic / Google (plus OSS where it fits) via Vercel AI SDK/direct SDKs; LangGraph/LangChain/OpenAI Assistants for agentic flows where appropriate.\n Prompt Ops & evals: Langfuse (prompt/version registry & tracing),\n Helicone/Promptfoo/RAGAS/DeepEval for quality & cost metrics.\n Background & orchestration: Inngest/[Trigger.dev](http://Trigger.dev) or Temporal; platform crons (Cloudflare/Vercel/EventBridge/Cloud Scheduler).\n Observability: OpenTelemetry traces + Sentry/Datadog/Grafana Cloud logs/dashboards.\n Delivery: GitHub Actions CI/CD, per-PR previews; GrowthBook/Unleash feature flags/A-B tests.\n Auth & enterprise: Auth.js/Clerk/Stytch for auth; WorkOS/Okta for SSO/SAML when needed.\n Comms integrations: Resend/Postmark/Mailgun (email), Twilio/MessageBird (SMS), Google/Microsoft Graph (calendar).\n AI-accelerated dev: Cursor, Claude, Copilot/Cody—used deliberately with human-in-the-loop reviews.\n\n \nOutcomes that define success (30 / 60 / 90)\n\nDay 30\n\n Architecture doc + lightweight threat model with platform choice rationale.\n Monorepo scaffold (Turborepo/pnpm, Biome/lint) + CI (GitHub Actions).\n Auth/roles live; first UI flows (companies/contacts); seeded Postgres/Prisma.\n Baseline AI: embeddings pipeline + eval harness wired into Langfuse; initial traces and cost/latency dashboard.\n\nDay 60 (MVP)\n\n Usable CRM: companies, contacts, pipeline, notes/tasks, saved views/search.\n Email/SMS I/O and unified activity timeline; background jobs running in prod.\n AI V1: RAG search, dedupe/matching, meeting/email summaries; eval dashboards and budget guards.\n\nDay 90\n\n Hardening: SLOs/alerts, audit logging, DR/backups (PITR), performance pass.\n First automations (auto-enrich → routing/sequences).\n Prompt versioning & A/Bs, red-team tests (injection/PII), model fallback/traffic splitting.\n\n \nNice to have\n\n CRM/ERP domain; deliverability and calendar integrations; analytics (PostHog/Segment).\n SOC2/GDPR exposure; incident response basics.\n Team-lead experience (mentoring, hiring loop, leveling).\n\n \nCompensation & equity\n\n Competitive salary + 5–10% founding-level equity\n Milestone bonuses tied to Day-60/90 deliverables.\n Change-of-control protection and refreshers at next financing.\n\nHow we work\n\n Small, senior, high-trust team; short cycles, small diffs, preview-before-merge.\n AI-accelerated dev, measured by quality, safety, and cost—not just speed.\n Security by default and data privacy from day one.\n\nProcess: \nIntro chat → Systems/product deep-dive → Practical pairing or time-boxed take-\nhome (≤3 hours) → Founder loop → Offer.\n\nApply: \nSend GitHub/portfolio/LinkedIn and a short note on a 0→1 or LLM-powered\nfeature you shipped (what changed and why) to [[email protected]](/cdn-\ncgi/l/email-\nprotectione28983968a8e87878ca28786958390868883818d809190878190978b968f878c96cc818d8fcc8397)\nwith Subject: Founding Full-Stack (AI CRM)",

You will join a strong team\nof engineers, have a direct impact on product metrics, enjoy a high degree of\ndecision-making autonomy, and receive a competitive compensation package.\n\n**Role & responsibilities**\n\n  * Design and develop human-like, action-level chatbots — dialog agents that not only converse naturally but also initiate and execute user workflows inside the product (data collection, process triggering, task completion).\n  * Participate in the architecture and development of an intelligent, context-aware translation system that preserves meaning, tone, and style.\n  * Lead experiments and deploy ML/NLP features into production with high stability and measurable results.\n  * Work with product and engineering teams to ensure fast, accurate, and reliable interaction between ML components and backend services.\n  * Own the full ML feature lifecycle: data collection, experimentation, model training, deployment, monitoring, and quality improvement.\n\n**Must-have requirements**\n\n  * 3+ years of experience with Python development and maintaining production-grade services.\n  * Experience in Web/API development (REST, versioning, logging, observability).\n  * Strong skills in Pandas, NumPy, and SQL for data processing and analysis.\n  * 1+ year of hands-on experience solving real ML tasks (NLP/CV) within production projects.\n  * Experience with TensorFlow, Keras, and/or Hugging Face frameworks.\n  * Understanding of model deployment and monitoring practices.\n  * Solid knowledge of GIT, HTTP(s), JSON/XML, and basic networking protocols (TCP/IP).\n  * Understanding of SDLC fundamentals, code review, CI/CD pipelines.\n  * Familiarity with LLM-based architectures (prompt engineering, RAG/fine-tuning, backend integration).\n  * Experience building intelligent chatbots that perform real actions in the product (not just FAQ or support bots).\n\n**Nice to have**\n\n  * Experience with PyTorch, SciPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n  * Experience with Docker, NoSQL or Vector Databases (e.g., Weaviate, PGVector, Milvus).\n  * Basic JavaScript knowledge for integrating ML services with the frontend.\n  * Diffusion-based image generation (e.g., Flux, LoRA, inference optimization) — optional, but a strong plus.\n  * Automated LLM evaluation frameworks (offline/online harnesses, A/B testing).\n  * Experience working with multimodal models (text↔image, vision-language).\n\n### How we work\n\n  * Engineering rigor: measurability, reproducibility, degradation control.\n  * Collaborative architecture: decisions driven by data, not intuition.\n  * Product focus: response time, accuracy, scenario conversion, and cost per task.\n\n**Working Conditions:**\n\n  * Remote work in a friendly and comfortable team of professional developers WITHOUT the oppression of marketers;\n  * On-time salary starting from $10000 gross;\n  * 2 weeks paid holiday a year;\n  * Paid sick days;\n  * Paid time off on major Slavic holidays;\n  * Opportunity to attend professional courses at company’s expense;\n  * Working week: Sunday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Israel time. \n\n**We would love to give you all the details about the position! Send your CV\nnow and we will contact you!**\n\n**!!! IMPORTANT TO KNOW !!!**\n\n**We have a multinational development team, which was formed more than 9 years\nago. Our team includes people living in different CIS countries, so the\nlanguage of communication is russian. But the company and all our employees\nare strongly opposed to russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company provides\nhumanitarian aid to Ukraine and helps our employees living there.**\n\n**We believe in the victory of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to ZSU! Glory\nto the Ukrainian nation!**",{"entities":[[0,11,"ROLE"],[137,167,"ROLE"],[1167,1175,"EXPERIENCE_YEARS"],[1195,1201,"SKILL_HARD"],[1275,1282,"SKILL_HARD"],[1360,1366,"SKILL_HARD"],[1368,1373,"SKILL_HARD"],[1379,1382,"SKILL_HARD"],[1421,1428,"EXPERIENCE_YEARS"],[1475,1481,"SKILL_HARD"],[1531,1541,"SKILL_HARD"],[1543,1548,"SKILL_HARD"],[1557,1581,"SKILL_HARD"],[1669,1672,"SKILL_HARD"],[1674,1678,"SKILL_HARD"],[1683,1691,"SKILL_HARD"],[1725,1731,"SKILL_HARD"],[1755,1759,"SKILL_HARD"],[1787,1792,"SKILL_HARD"],[1850,1868,"SKILL_HARD"],[1870,1885,"SKILL_HARD"],[1887,1906,"SKILL_HARD"],[2066,2073,"SKILL_HARD"],[2075,2080,"SKILL_HARD"],[2082,2088,"SKILL_HARD"],[2090,2100,"SKILL_HARD"],[2102,2111,"SKILL_HARD"],[2115,2126,"SKILL_HARD"],[2147,2153,"SKILL_HARD"],[2155,2160,"SKILL_HARD"],[2164,2180,"SKILL_HARD"],[2188,2196,"SKILL_HARD"],[2198,2206,"SKILL_HARD"],[2208,2214,"SKILL_HARD"],[2227,2237,"SKILL_HARD"],[2339,2343,"SKILL_HARD"],[2345,2349,"SKILL_HARD"],[2473,2484,"SKILL_HARD"],[2515,2532,"SKILL_HARD"],[2845,2856,"LOCATION"],[2960,2974,"BENEFIT"],[3007,3034,"BENEFIT"],[3040,3054,"BENEFIT"],[3060,3098,"BENEFIT"],[3126,3146,"BENEFIT"],[3649,3657,"LOCATION"]]}]]}

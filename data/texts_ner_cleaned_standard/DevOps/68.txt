DevOps Engineer
We are seeking a skilled and proactive DevOps Engineer to join our technology
team. The ideal candidate will take ownership of the infrastructure, build and
deploy pipelines, and operational reliability of our platforms. A key aspect
of this role will be collaborating closely with our external hosting provider,
who delivers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), to ensure secure, scalable,
and resilient environments.
Key Responsibilities:

Infrastructure Management:
Work with our hosting partner to design, implement, and maintain cloud-based
infrastructure. Ensure optimal performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency
across environments.

Test Automation & CI/CD:
Build and manage continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Automate
build, test, and release processes to enable rapid and reliable software
delivery.

Monitoring & Reliability:
Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and logging solutions to ensure high
system availability. Perform root-cause analysis of production issues and
drive improvements.

Security & Compliance:
Collaborate with the IaaS provider to apply security best practices, including
access control, encryption, patch management, and compliance monitoring.

Collaboration with Hosting Partner:
Act as the technical liaison between internal development teams and the IaaS
hosting company. Define service-level expectations, manage infrastructure
changes, and coordinate incident response and performance optimization.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Develop and maintain infrastructure through code using tools such as
Terraform, Ansible, or similar. Ensure version-controlled, repeatable, and
auditable configurations.

System Optimization:
Continuously evaluate and enhance system performance, scaling, and cost
efficiency

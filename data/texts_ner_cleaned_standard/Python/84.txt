Ardupilot Engineer
Swarmer is a Vendor-Agnostic Autonomy for Coordinated Robots. We develop
AI-managed collaborative autonomy to make teams of connected drones and
autonomous systems smart, efficient, and self-improving over time.

Currently, we are looking for an ArdupilotEngineer.

📌 ROLE OVERVIEW:

We are seeking a skilled and motivated Ardupilot Engineer to design,
implement, and optimize autonomous flight control solutions for UAVs and
robotic platforms. The ideal candidate will have strong experience working
with Ardupilot or PX4 , a deep understanding of MAVLink communication,
system configuration, flight tuning, and debugging , and a passion for
pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems. You’ll collaborate with AI,
perception, and mission-planning teams to build reliable, adaptive, and
intelligent multi-robot systems.

📌 WHAT YOU’LL DO:

Develop, configure, and test Ardupilot-based flight control systems for various UAV platforms.
Debug and optimize flight behaviors, parameters, and mission execution in both SITL (Software-in-the-Loop) and real flight environments
Work closely with hardware engineers to support sensor integration (GPS, cameras, LiDAR, etc.) and ensure robust flight performance.
Contribute to documentation, simulation environments, and internal development standards.

📌 WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

3+ years of hands-on experience with Ardupilot , PX4 , or similar open-source autopilot stacks.
Strong knowledge of MAVLink , mission planning , and UAV communication protocols.
Practical experience with UAV tuning , flight testing, and log analysis (Mission Planner, MAVProxy, etc.).
Experience with EKF configuration, tuning, and debugging to ensure accurate navigation and state estimation.
Understanding of autonomous navigation/LMT/VizNav, control theory, or multi-agent coordination
Ability to work independently in a fast-paced R&D environment.
Experience working with Python or any similar language for custom module development. — a strong plus.
Familiarity with Linux environments and onboard companion computer setups (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or similar). — a strong plus.
Knowledge of Betaflight/INAV or other flight controller firmware — a strong plus.

📌 WE OFFER:

Direct impact in a high-stakes industry where your work enables autonomous systems used on the ground.
Professional growth through exposure to advanced UAV autonomy technologies and international DevOps best practices.
Competitive salary and comprehensive benefits package (insurance, paid sick leave, 20 paid days off per year).
Benefits of the defense sector (reservation and related advantages).
Flexible remote work options (possibility to commute to the office if needed is essential).

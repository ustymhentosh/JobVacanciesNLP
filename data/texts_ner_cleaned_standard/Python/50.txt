Backend Engineer with Python (Middle/Senior)
We are a Ukrainian-born Travel and Hospitality Technology Consulting company,
partnering with online travel agencies, travel management solution providers,
and startups worldwide. With expertise across Travel Tech, Data Science,
UI/UX, Business Analysis, and Software Engineering, we’ve successfully
delivered over 300 projects.

We are now seeking a Backend Engineer to join one of our client projects
focused on building scalable, intelligent systems that redefine customer
engagement. You’ll play a key role in designing cloud-native services,
integrating AI-driven APIs, and ensuring that the platform is reliable, high-
performing, and ready for large-scale usage.

The team is developing a next-generation platform for customer engagement
powered by generative AI. The solution enables travel and lifestyle companies
to deploy intelligent, always-available digital agents that provide
personalized support and seamless brand interactions at scale. By combining
advanced GenAI models with a proprietary learning engine and deep integration
into business systems, the platform helps brands create efficient, consistent,
and meaningful conversations with their customers.

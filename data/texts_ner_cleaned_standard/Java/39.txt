Middle/Senior Java Developer
We are a telecommunications group led by lifecell. We’re the top choice
for number portability—more customers switch to us from other operators than
to anyone else. During wartime, we prioritize keeping the country connected:
we invest in batteries and generators to ensure our base stations operate even
during power outages.

Ukraine work together within our group of companies to advance telecom every

Senior Java Developer
We are looking for a Senior Back-End Developer to take ownership of complex
backend systems, lead technical architecture decisions, and mentor the next
generation of developers. You will work with cutting-edge technologies to
design, build, and optimize services that impact billions of mobile users
worldwide.

This is a hands-on leadership role — ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-
moving environment, enjoys collaborating across functions, and is driven to
deliver scalable, reliable, and future-proof systems.
Requirements:

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience;
6+ years of professional Java development experience;
Proven track record in designing and delivering complex distributed systems and microservices (Docker, Kubernetes);
Strong understanding of scalability, concurrency, and performance optimization challenges;
Hands-on experience with CI/CD tools and automated build/deployment pipelines;
Proficiency in Spring & Spring Boot frameworks;
Excellent communication skills and the ability to influence technical direction across teams;
Experience running applications on Kubernetes, with a focus on designing services that scale efficiently and consume resources effectively (rather than cluster administration);
Ability to measure and improve application performance using profiling, benchmarking, and APM tools (e.g., JFR, JMeter, Micrometer, New Relic, Datadog).
Responsibilities:

Design and develop highly scalable, modular backend applications and APIs using Java and Spring Boot;
Own the full development lifecycle — from requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing to deployment and monitoring in production;
Lead initiatives to improve system scalability, performance, and security;
Collaborate closely with Product, Algo, DevOps, BI, and Marketing to deliver integrated, business-driven solutions;
Ensure observability through robust logging, metrics, and alerting with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana;
Drive adoption of engineering best practices, code quality standards, and technical documentation;
Mentor and guide junior developers, fostering knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
Will be a plus:

Background with NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Couchbase) and SQL databases;
Knowledge of reactive programming (Spring WebFlux);
Familiarity with monitoring and alerting tools such as Prometheus, Grafana and Kibana.
What we offer:

Help and support from our caring HR team;
20 days of vacation;
Health Insurance;
Gym Subscription (Multisport);
The exchange of experience and work with talented colleagues;
Last but not least — valuable compensation for your efforts.

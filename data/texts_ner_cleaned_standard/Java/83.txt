Java Engineer (AI-driven environment)
We are looking for a software engineer to join a HubSpot engineering team
creating demo environments and demo data for Sales teams using artificial
intelligence and agents. The main principles of our work are software
reliability and helping the user to achieve their goals. You will have plenty
of opportunities to work in the microservices architecture with cutting-edge
technologies.

HubSpot is one of the best technology companies in the USA. HubSpot has a
great engineering culture, carried by great teams in the USA, Ireland,
Germany, Ukraine and Armenia. The platform consists of thousands of
microservices built with Java 21, lightweight DropWizard framework, and Google
Guice dependency injection. It’s huge and you’ll have to deal with a lot of
other stuff like Kafka, Amazon SQS, S3, HBase, and much more. Front-end is
single-page applications built with ECMAScript 6, React, and Sass.
Approximately 1000 Front-end repositories. The Platform Team built up the
state of the art infrastructure that allows developers to deploy their code to
QA and Production with literally 3 button clicks — you will be able to spend
all of your time designing and developing software — there is nothing easier
than triggering a build and merge here.

Intelliarts Ltd. is a boutique software engineering company established in
1999, in Lviv, Ukraine. We launch and support dedicated development teams that
help startups and technology companies worldwide to build awesome products.

Senior Full-Stack (Node/React)
Mealco is transforming how restaurants manage their online presence
through our comprehensive SaaS platform. We help restaurants streamline
operations across major delivery platforms like UberEats and DoorDash while
providing powerful analytics and AI-driven insights to optimize their
business.

We believe in high-impact, AI-driven development where small, focused teams
deliver exceptional results through smart engineering, automation, and deep
product ownership.

lean, high-performance environment where every team member makes a significant
impact. You’re self-directed, take ownership of complex problems, and use AI
tools to work smarter and faster.

In our small team, there’s no room for passengers—we need A-players who can
handle ambiguity, drive projects to completion, and contribute meaningfully to
our mission of empowering restaurants.

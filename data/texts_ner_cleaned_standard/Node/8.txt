Full-stack JavaScript developer
We’re looking for Mid+/Senior FullStack JS developers who love technical
interviews. Your primary responsibility is to pass client technical
assessments (live coding, architecture/system-design conversations) across
both frontend and backend (Node.js/NestJS). You’ll help us win projects by
demonstrating deep technical capability and clear communication — while
sharpening your own skills across many interview styles and stacks.

What you’ll do:

Join client technical screens as the hands-on engineer, solve problems live, and explain trade-offs with clarity.
Navigate a variety of interview formats: algorithmic/DSA rounds, frontend architecture/performance/testing/accessibility, backend design with Node.js/NestJS, API design, testing, networking, and security basics.
Discuss modern FE stacks (TypeScript, React or Vue, Vite/Webpack, SSR/ISR) and robust BE stacks:

Node.js with NestJS (or Express/Fastify), TypeScript first.
API patterns: REST/GraphQL, WebSockets, pagination, versioning, error models.
Data layer: PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB, Redis (caching, sessions, rate limiting), ORMs (Prisma/TypeORM), migrations, indexing.
Integration: queues/streams (RabbitMQ/Kafka/SQS), file/object storage, third-party auth/payments.
Cloud & ops: Docker, basic CI/CD, env/config management, logging/metrics (e.g., ELK/EFK, OpenTelemetry), 12-factor sensibilities, some experience with Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP).

You’re a great fit if you:

Have 5+ years of professional experience in frontend + backend engineering.
Are fluent in TypeScript ; expert in React (preferred) or Vue , and confident with Node.js/NestJS (routing, modules, DI, pipes/guards/interceptors).
Can reason about rendering (CSR/SSR/SSG/ISR), state (local/global/query), performance (code-splitting, memoization, hydration), and accessibility (ARIA, WCAG).
Can design backends with solid domain boundaries, data modeling, transactionality , caching , and consistency ; you understand indexes , query plans , and when to choose SQL vs NoSQL.
Are comfortable with live coding (practical FS tasks + algorithms), system design for the web (load shedding, CDNs, caching layers, queues, pub/sub, eventual consistency), and security basics (OAuth2/OIDC/JWT, CSRF/CORS, CSP, input validation, OWASP Top 10).
Write tests when it matters: Jest/Vitest , RTL , Supertest , contract tests; can discuss coverage vs. ROI.
Communicate clearly in English (B2+) , keep calm under pressure, and enjoy explaining your thinking.

Compensation & schedule:

Hourly pay + success bonuses tied to passed interviews/closed engagements.
Part-time & flexible (typ. 8–20 hours/week).
Contractor engagement; remote-first.

Apply:
Send your CV/LinkedIn + GitHub/portfolio + a short note on your strongest
interview topics. If you have preferred stacks, mention them. We’ll invite you
to a brief intro call followed by a friendly mock round.

About the role

We are building a revolutionary system at the frontier of technology and

As a Software Engineer , you won’t just write code — you will shape the
future of how apps are built. You’ll be part of the early execution

reliability. Expect tight loops, clear ownership, and visible impact. You will
engage directly with first clients, adapt the platform to their needs, and set
the stage for the next generation of software creation.

Open-minded explorer — ready to try bold ideas, new approaches, and cutting-edge tools.
Hacker mindset & problem solver — able to connect the dots across complex systems and find elegant solutions.
Analytical & resilient — thrives in debugging intricate, interconnected architectures.
Startup speed enthusiast — comfortable hacking fast, shipping early, learning from feedback, and polishing later.
Experienced in Cursor or Claude Code.
Passionate about vibe-coding — turning AI into your engineering team-mate.
Natural leader — with the drive to inspire and guide people.
Why join us?

Be among the first engineers driving a bold, world-changing vision.
Work at the bleeding edge of technology and AI , where experimentation is not just allowed but expected.
Direct influence on product.
A chance to build something that reshapes how things get done in today’s world.

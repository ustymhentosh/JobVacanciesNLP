About the Role:

We’re looking for a proactive iOS developer ready to work with SwiftUI and
next-gen AI technologies to help grow Photo Editor, one of Kiss My Apps’ key
products, and join the launch of a brand-new app from scratch.

You’ll collaborate closely with the product team, not just coding features but
also shaping them and influencing both technical and product decisions. If you
want to grow, contribute to new apps from the ground up, and be involved in
every step from concept to release, this role is for you.

Your responsibilities:

Collaborate with product, design, and development teams to shape and deliver new app features;
Take part in product planning, architecture, and decision-making discussions;
Build modern user interfaces with SwiftUI;
Implement and optimize data storage solutions (Core Data, caching, offline mode);
Experiment with and integrate generative AI models into mobile products;
Contribute to new applications from scratch — from concept to App Store release;
Proactively suggest improvements — both technical and product-related — to enhance UX and app performance.

What we expect from you:

1+ years of commercial experience in iOS development using SwiftUI;
Understanding of app architecture, memory management, concurrency, and network stack.
Clear communication and a product-oriented mindset — you understand what you build and why.
Knowledge of Apple StoreKit (subscriptions, in-app purchases) — a strong plus, but not mandatory;
Experience with Core Data or other database frameworks;

Nice to have:

Familiarity with UIKit + Storyboards;
Experience working with AI tools in development.

You’re a great fit if you’re looking to:

Work in a fast-paced environment with minimal bureaucracy;
Be involved in product decisions and see the impact of your work;
Collaborate in a cross-functional team that values input from everyone;
Join a growing team where your contributions matter from day one.

We offer:

1. Work format of your choice: fully remote from anywhere in the free world, as well as access to one of our offices if desired (Kyiv, Warsaw).
2. Conditions that help you focus on performance: fair compensation that matches your skills and experience. We also provide equipment regardless of work format and location.
3. Career growth through action: 80%+ of all leads at Kiss My Apps were switchers just 2–3 years ago. Your impact here isn’t defined by years on your resume — it’s defined by how quickly you learn, take responsibility, and own your career.
4. Well-being program: we care about the mental health of our team and provide access to individual or group therapy sessions with a corporate psychologist, as well as online yoga classes twice a week.
5. Development and professional fulfillment: we host internal English speaking clubs with a native speaker, and offer opportunities to speak at internal and external events by Kiss My Apps. In addition, you’ll have an annual budget to cover up to 50% of the cost of professional conferences, educational events, and training.
6. Additional benefits of your choice: We offer a fixed annual budget for you to decide how to spend — 50% coverage of health insurance, therapy, sports, or dental care. Plus, 40 days of paid vacation and sick leave with no date restrictions.
7. Support during wartime: we provide everything needed for uninterrupted work, systematically support the Defense Forces, and participate in Ukraine’s recovery initiatives.
8. Networking that drives you forward: access to events from Netpeak Group and beyond.

Hiring process:

1. Introductory call with a recruiter — 45 min to discuss your expectations, experience, and KMA’s culture;
2. Technical interview — to better understand your approach and thinking;
3. Final stage — closing interview with the CTO.

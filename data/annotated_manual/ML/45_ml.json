We deliver tailored software solutions across Healthcare,\nWellbeing, Airline, and other industries. Since 2008, we’ve been providing\nfull-cycle software development, data and analytics, cloud engineering, ML &\ndata engineering service, full-cycle development of AI solutions, and digital\nmarketing orchestration for clients across Western Europe and North America.\n\nOur solution is one of Symphony’s most innovative projects — an AI-powered\npersonal intelligence platform that acts as a digital twin and “second brain.”\nIt combines Voice services, multi-agents, external memory architecture, and\nLLM fine-tuning to simplify complex digital interactions and provide\npersonalized insights for users.\n\nAs the AI Solution Architect, you’ll play a pivotal role in designing the\nplatform’s technical and AI foundations, ensuring its security, scalability,\nreliability, and intelligence.\n\n### You will be an excellent fit for this position if you have:\n\n**Core Experience:**\n\n  * 7+ years of experience in software development (Python, Kotlin, Java, or C#), including 2+ years in solution or AI architecture.\n  * Proven track record in AI/ML system design, integrating speech recognition (Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Speech to Speech), NLP, and contextual search, development of Gen-AI-based solutions, including RAG, LLM fine-tuning, and real-time speech handling.\n  * Experience leading cross-functional teams (AI, data, mobile, and backend engineers).\n  * Deep understanding of mobile and cloud integration patterns.\n  * Familiarity with Agile/Lean delivery and startup-like MVP development environments.\n\n**Architecture & Cloud Proficiency**\n\n  * Expertise in GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Firestore, BigQuery ML, Serverless, Firebase and Postgres); AWS and Azure also acceptable.\n  * Strong grasp of microservice, event-driven, and serverless architectures.\n  * CI/CD, containerization, and observability experience (GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana), experience working with vector and graph databases.\n  * Experience implementing privacy-first AI architectures (GDPR-compliant data storage, anonymization, zero-knowledge).\n\n**AI & GenAI Expertise**\n\n  * Practical understanding of LLMs, LLM fine-tuning, RAG, multi-modality, Agentic AI, and Multi-agent architecture.\n  * Hands-on experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or AutoGen for model orchestration.\n  * Knowledge of vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and contextual memory design.\n  * Familiarity with speech-to-text and TTS models (Whisper, Azure Cognitive Services, ElevenLabs).\n  * Understanding of prompt engineering, meta prompting, and evaluation frameworks (TruLens, Vertex Evals).\n  * Awareness of AI trust, explainability, and bias mitigation practices.\n\n**Data Systems & Engineering**\n\n  * Experience with data ingestion and transformation pipelines (Airflow, Kafka, Spark).\n  * Familiarity with embedding-based search systems and knowledge graph structures.\n  * Understanding of semantic memory models for personal assistant applications.\n\n**Soft Skills**\n\n  * Excellent stakeholder communication and technical storytelling.\n  * Consulting mindset — ability to shape technical vision based on evolving business goals.\n  * Capable of leading AI discovery workshops, technical PoCs, and pre-sales solution design.\n  * Collaborative leadership, inspiring innovation and ownership across the team.\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n\n  * Master’s degree in Computer Science, AI, or Data Engineering.\n  * Nice to have certifications: AWS ML Specialty, Google ML Engineer, or Cloud Architect (any platform).\n  * Previous experience designing AI-first consumer or voice-based applications.\n  * Strong understanding of AI governance, trust, and responsible AI principles.\n  * Proven delivery record in AI companion or context-aware assistant projects.\n\n### Here are some of the things you’ll be working on:\n\n**Mission**\n\n  * Define and drive the AI architecture and technical direction for the platform.\n  * Transform business goals (e.g., digital twin, second brain, contextual AI) into scalable and production-ready solutions.\n  * Collaborate with Product Owner, Delivery Manager, and AI engineers to align strategy, feasibility, and innovation.\n\n**Key Responsibilities**\n\n  * Architect end-to-end architecture and design of the application, including its components: mobile apps, real-time voice handling, AI agents, and cloud infra services.\n  * Design agentic orchestration pipelines that allow autonomous collaboration between AI agents.\n  * Oversee the integration of LLMs, embeddings, vectors, networks, and other databases into the core memory framework.\n  * Define data privacy and ethical AI guidelines for the product.\n  * Support PoC and MVP phases, validating approaches for multimodal (voice/text) interactions.\n  * Mentor engineering teams in AI-first architecture and MLOps/LLMOps best practices.\n  * Lead technical feasibility assessments and manage trade-offs between innovation and scalability.\n  * Collaborate on AI roadmap evolution toward a fully personalized, on-device digital twin.\n\n**Expected Results**\n\n  * Deliver a robust AI architecture blueprint.\n  * Co-led the Agentic Orchestration Layer design and deployment for internal and production use.\n  * Implement end-to-end LLM evaluation & monitoring within 6 months of MVP launch.\n  * Enable continuous learning and improvement loops across AI components (speech, memory, reasoning).",{"entities":[[0,21,"ROLE"],[73,91,"COMPANY"],[552,562,"COMPANY"],[869,890,"ROLE"],[1136,1144,"EXPERIENCE_YEARS"],[1184,1190,"SKILL_HARD"],[1192,1198,"SKILL_HARD"],[1200,1204,"SKILL_HARD"],[1209,1211,"SKILL_HARD"],[1224,1232,"EXPERIENCE_YEARS"],[1292,1297,"SKILL_HARD"],[1345,1359,"SKILL_HARD"],[1361,1375,"SKILL_HARD"],[1377,1393,"SKILL_HARD"],[1396,1399,"SKILL_HARD"],[1405,1422,"SKILL_HARD"],[1473,1476,"SKILL_HARD"],[1478,1493,"SKILL_HARD"],[1824,1827,"SKILL_HARD"],[1829,1838,"SKILL_HARD"],[1840,1849,"SKILL_HARD"],[1851,1860,"SKILL_HARD"],[1862,1873,"SKILL_HARD"],[1875,1885,"SKILL_HARD"],[1887,1895,"SKILL_HARD"],[1900,1908,"SKILL_HARD"],[1911,1914,"SKILL_HARD"],[1919,1924,"SKILL_HARD"],[2024,2029,"SKILL_HARD"],[2079,2093,"SKILL_HARD"],[2095,2105,"SKILL_HARD"],[2107,2113,"SKILL_HARD"],[2115,2125,"SKILL_HARD"],[2127,2134,"SKILL_HARD"],[2311,2315,"SKILL_HARD"],[2318,2335,"SKILL_HARD"],[2368,2372,"SKILL_HARD"],[2374,2389,"SKILL_HARD"],[2391,2394,"SKILL_HARD"],[2396,2410,"SKILL_HARD"],[2412,2422,"SKILL_HARD"],[2428,2453,"SKILL_HARD"],[2483,2492,"SKILL_HARD"],[2494,2504,"SKILL_HARD"],[2509,2516,"SKILL_HARD"],[2577,2585,"SKILL_HARD"],[2587,2593,"SKILL_HARD"],[2595,2603,"SKILL_HARD"],[2656,2670,"SKILL_HARD"],[2675,2678,"SKILL_HARD"],[2687,2694,"SKILL_HARD"],[2696,2720,"SKILL_HARD"],[2722,2732,"SKILL_HARD"],[2819,2826,"SKILL_HARD"],[2828,2840,"SKILL_HARD"],[3015,3022,"SKILL_HARD"],[3024,3029,"SKILL_HARD"],[3031,3036,"SKILL_HARD"],[3226,3261,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3266,3289,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3294,3312,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3481,3505,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3507,3527,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3532,3541,"SKILL_SOFT"],[3594,3655,"DEGREE"]]}],["AI

**CQUELLE** is a boutique software development company that helps clients in
FinTech, HealthTech, InsurTech, and AdTech build reliable and long-lasting
digital products. Our focus is on quality, pragmatism, and strong engineering
culture, not bureaucracy. We keep teams small, communication clear, and
responsibilities real.

We’re looking for a **Senior Full Stack Developer** who enjoys solving complex
problems, takes ownership, and can turn ideas into well-crafted solutions.
You’ll work in a collaborative environment where initiative is valued and
results matter more than process.

### **About the Role**

You’ll join a small, experienced team delivering custom software products for
international clients. Most of our projects are built on .NET and React, with
Azure or AWS infrastructure.  
You’ll take part in system design, architecture discussions, and help drive
technical excellence across the codebase.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Design, develop, and maintain backend and frontend components using **.NET** and **React**
  * Participate in architectural decisions and project planning
  * Collaborate directly with clients and product owners
  * Estimate, plan, and deliver features on time
  * Review code, mentor teammates, and share best practices
  * Continuously improve code quality, automation, and process efficiency

### **Requirements**

  * **5+ years** of hands-on experience in **.NET (Core, ASP.NET, Web API)** and **React**
  * Strong understanding of OOP, SOLID, and clean architecture
  * Experience with Entity Framework, SQL, and REST API design
  * Confident working with existing codebases and legacy logic
  * Good English communication skills for daily client interaction
  * Proactive mindset — you look for better ways, not just tasks to complete

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience with Azure/AWS, CI/CD pipelines, or unit testing frameworks
  * Familiarity with microservice or modular architectures
  * Understanding of security and performance optimization

### **What We Offer**

  * Competitive compensation
  * Fully remote work with flexible hours
  * Work in a small, focused team that values autonomy and clarity
  * Projects that make sense — not endless maintenance
  * A culture that rewards problem solvers and self-driven professionals

We are looking for a **Senior .NET Developer** for our client — a global
product company developing cutting-edge trading technology solutions for
regulated brokers and trading firms. Their SaaS products power electronic
trading, brokerage operations, risk management, and financial data analysis
worldwide.

The ideal candidate is not just a coder but an engineer with a product mindset
— someone who understands the project end-to-end, proactively asks questions,
and strives to make a real impact. This role requires taking ownership of
solutions, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, suggesting
improvements, and contributing to the growth of high-performance trading
platforms.

### Responsibilities

  * **Development and Coding:** Writing clean, structured, and optimized C# code following SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI principles, working with APIs, databases, logging, and monitoring.
  * **Testing and Debugging:** Creating unit/integration tests, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance.
  * **Database Management:** Designing, optimizing queries, and managing migrations.
  * **CI/CD:** Automating builds and deployments, working with Git and release processes.
  * **Refactoring and Optimization:** Improving code readability, performance, and architecture.
  * **Deep technical collaboration** : Driving architectural discussions, performing advanced code reviews, and supporting cross-functional integration at a low level.
  * **Ownership of production reliability** : Diagnosing root causes of production issues, optimizing runtime behavior, and managing incident resolution pipelines.
  * **Mentoring** : Training colleagues, assisting with complex technical challenges, and introducing new approaches and tools.

### Requirements

  * 5+ years of working experience with C#;
  * Strong knowledge of the .NET stack (we are using .net core);
  * Proven experience designing and implementing complex system architectures patterns;
  * Deep practical knowledge of software development lifecycle;
  * Experience in building resilient, high-load microservices with asynchronous communication and distributed data storage;
  * Git, GitLab, understanding of CI\CD processes;
  * Hands-on experience with Docker;
  * Familiarity with RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka;  

  * In-depth expertise in TCP/IP stack, gRPC, WebSockets, and low-latency network optimizations;
  * Knowledge of Relational DBs and NoSQL DBs — we are using Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB;
  * Advanced experience integrating observability stacks (e.g. OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time diagnostics and distributed tracing.

### What in it for you

  * **Care from Day One:** Medical insurance starting immediately (including dental care, massages, and professional psychological support) — because your well-being matters.
  * **Work-Life Balance:** 25 days of paid vacation + 30 days of sick leave, so you can truly rest and recover without stress.
  * **Energy Investment:** Partial reimbursement for sports activities to help you stay active and energized.
  * **Continuous Growth:** Partial coverage for English or Ukrainian language courses plus a fixed budget for professional development — choose the learning path that fits you best.
  * **Knowledge Library:** Access to a well-stocked office library and Kuka online library to learn, grow, and get inspired.
  * **Island Retreat:** 14 days per year at the company’s corporate villa in Cyprus — perfect for recharging.

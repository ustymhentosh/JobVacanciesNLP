### About the Project

The company builds real-time tracking, communication, and data analytics
systems for organizations operating in challenging or remote environments.

Their solutions combine:

  * **Hardware** (trackers & telemetry devices) — installed on aircraft, vehicles, boats, or worn by personnel to monitor movement and equipment status
  * **Cloud platform** — collects data from devices, displays it on maps, sends alerts, and helps managers make real-time decisions

### Why It Matters

  * In industries where every second counts — such as aerial firefighting — the system helps visualize exactly where aircraft are located, when they’re making water drops, etc.
  * The platform works even in remote or hard-to-reach areas where standard communication may be weak
  * It goes beyond simple “who’s where” tracking — it analyzes data, detects unusual behavior, alerts if a device stops transmitting, and provides analytics for future mission planning

**In short:** This solution helps companies and services know where their
people and equipment are, whether everything is operating normally, and
enables rapid response when something goes wrong. Their technology combines
devices + global connectivity + intelligent software to make remote or high-
risk operations safer and more efficient.

### 💼 Position Details

**Role:** C# Backend Developer (Cloud Infrastructure)  
**Engagement:** Full-time, short-term contract  
**Duration:** 1-2 months  
**Start date:** ASAP

### Tech Stack of the project

  * **Backend:** C# with .NET, hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  * **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS (handled by frontend team)

### What You’ll Work On

  * Backend development and cloud infrastructure on GCP
  * Building and optimizing services for real-time data processing
  * Working with distributed systems handling telemetry and tracking data

### Working Arrangement

**Important note:** The team is based in New Zealand, so initially you’ll need
to work some night hours 🌙 to onboard and sync with the team. After the
onboarding phase, work can be done asynchronously.What Makes This Project
Great

You’ll be working on cloud-based systems that directly impact safety and
efficiency in critical operations — from aerial firefighting to remote
logistics. It’s a chance to contribute to backend infrastructure that makes
dangerous work safer and helps teams operate effectively in the most
challenging environments.

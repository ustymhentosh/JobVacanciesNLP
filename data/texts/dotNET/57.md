**This role:**

We’re looking for someone with passion for and experience with e-commerce and
payments. As the Technical Lead for our Direct-to-Consumer Payment Platform,
you’ll own the platform responsible for moving over 100m in revenue through
our DTC web stores across multiple games. You’ll drive the technical vision,
run a product team, and own the business outcomes for the platform. The role
is a blend of architectural ownership, individual contribution, and people
management. You’ll be responsible for driving platform stability,
observability and high-trust user experience while enabling streamlined
integration with third party payment providers.

**Who you are:**

We’re looking for someone eager to innovate and challenge the status quo.
You’re willing to take risks and own outcomes. You embrace working with others
to overcome challenging problems. You speak up when you have ideas and welcome
debate. You learn what you need to know, teach what you already know, and
encourage the same in others. You lead your team and influence internal
partners to build best-in-class products.

**Who we are:**

We’re a team of huge nerds distributed around the world working on SciPlay’s
modern platform for our games — the Payments Platform is just one piece of it.
We thrive when we solve problems together and when we challenge each other. We
strive to continually improve our skills and our culture, both in our team and
throughout the company. We build empowered product teams with autonomy to make
decisions and experiment to solve business problems, and we provide a cushion
when things go sideways.

It’s hard, and we love it.

**What we’ll do together:**

We’ll solve cool problems. We’ll build new products. We’ll develop new
features.

We’ll primarily work in C#/.NET and React/Typescript in AWS, but we also
regularly touch ADO, SQL, and Terraform, with some Python and PHP splashed
into the mix.

Have some of that but not all of it? Our team will help you fill in the gaps.
We care more about how you think and solve problems than syntax.

If we sound like the kind of people you want to work with, let’s talk.

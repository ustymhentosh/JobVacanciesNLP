We are seeking a **Senior Golang Developer**. It is essential that the person
is highly product-driven, self-motivated, speaks **excellent English** , and
enjoys using coding AI tools like **Claude Code**.

**Our stack:**

  * Frontend: SvelteKit, turbo monorepo, Vercel
  * Backend: Golang monorepo
  * AI: Claude Code (mandatory), other agentic coding tools

**What you’ll actually do:**

  * Own features end-to-end: from specs to deployment to fixing bugs
  * Use Claude Code to generate Golang backend code
  * Review AI output for quality and architectural fit
  * Fix bugs to learn our codebase, then rapidly build new features
  * Make quick decisions on what to build vs buy vs generate with AI
  * Talk to customers when they report issues and ship fixes the same day

**You must have:**

  * Ownership mentality with a strive for elegantly simple, high-quality solutions
  * Strive for max quality — you test your own work thoroughly since we have no QA team, everything you ship MUST work
  * Product mindset — you care about WHY we’re building something
  * Proven experience using Claude Code or similar agentic AI (Cursor, Windsurf) 
  * Strong Golang experience — you’ll review AI’s code in Golang, and you must understand how it works
  * Broad architectural knowledge of building modern full-stack applications
  * Excellent spoken English and a good internet connection for daily video calls

**You are a great fit if you:**

  * Get frustrated when development takes weeks instead of days
  * You think in features and architecture, and not single lines of code
  * Can spot subtle bugs in AI-generated code quickly
  * You ship fast, but always verify it actually works
  * Have shipped real products that customers actually use
  * Think “how can AI build this?” as your first instinct

**‼️ Red flags (don’t apply if):**

  * You’ve never used Claude Code or similar AI coding tools
  * Your English is intermediate
  * You need detailed specs before starting
  * You see AI as a threat rather than leverage

**When you apply for this role, please answer the following questions:**

  1. Do you have commercial experience using Claude Code? Do you have it listed on your CV? Alternatively, do you have commercial experience using Cursor / Windsurf?
  2. How much commercial experience do you have with Golang?
  3. What is your current level of proficiency in English?
  4. Please share your monthly salary expectations (gross amount in USD).
  5. Where are you based?

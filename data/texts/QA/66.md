  5. Practical knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices related to test automation.
  6. Deep understanding of test design principles, code review, and refactoring.
  7. English at B2+ (ability to communicate confidently with international teams on technical topics).  
  

**Nice to Have**

  * Hands-on security or performance testing experience.
  * Experience with observability & monitoring tools.

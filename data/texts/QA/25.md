**Location:** Remote (full-time) • **Stack:** iOS/Android (NativeScript +
Flutter), Web (Angular), REST APIs (Node.js), Firestore, MongoDB • **Tools:**
Playwright, k6, Postman/Bruno, Jira, GitHub Actions

  
**The Role**

We’re hiring a **mid-level QA Engineer** to own end-to-end quality for our
**iOS/Android apps** , **Angular web app** , and **REST APIs**. You’ll split
your time roughly **60% manual / 40% automation** , create clear test
documentation, and plug automated tests into CI to keep releases healthy.  

**What you’ll do**

  * **Plan & document quality**: author test plans, regression suites, and release checklists for mobile, web, and APIs.
  * **Manual testing** : functional, exploratory, and regression testing on **real devices** (iOS + Android).
  * **Automation** : build and maintain **Playwright** UI/API tests (TypeScript), including smoke, happy-path, and key regressions for Angular web and critical mobile user flows (where feasible).
  * **API testing** : validate REST endpoints with **Postman/Bruno** , data checks against **Firestore** and **MongoDB**.
  * **Performance** : create **k6** scenarios for critical endpoints and user journeys; track baselines and catch regressions.
  * **Integrations** : test data flows with **Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, CRMs/ERPs** (auth, sync jobs, webhooks, field mappings).
  * **CI & release**: run tests in **GitHub Actions** , triage failures, and contribute to release gates for **dev/staging**.
  * **Distribution** : validate builds via **TestFlight** and **Firebase App Distribution / Play Console internal testing** as applicable.
  * **Analytics & stability**: verify events and sanity-check crash/issue reports (Sentry/Crashlytics if available).
  * **Collaboration** : work closely with engineering and product to reproduce issues, sharpen acceptance criteria, and prevent repeats.  

**30/60/90 Day Outcomes**

  * **30 days:**  

    * Current-state test plan and regression matrix for iOS, Android, Angular, and APIs.
    * Playwright smoke suite covering auth, navigation, and core flows; k6 baseline for 1–2 critical endpoints.
    * Clear defect taxonomy and Jira workflow in place.
  * **60 days:**  

    * Expanded Playwright coverage for top revenue/usage paths; API regression collection in Postman/Bruno.
    * Mobile real-device regression checklist + priority device/version matrix.
    * CI jobs in GitHub Actions running on PR and pre-release with go/no-go signals.
  * **90 days:**  

    * Stable automated smoke + targeted regression suites gating releases.
    * Performance thresholds and alerts for critical APIs.
    * Documented test data strategy for dev/staging; repeatable test datasets.  

**Must-have experience**

  * **3–5 years** in QA with both **manual and automation** responsibilities.
  * **Mobile testing** on **real iOS/Android devices** (NativeScript and/or Flutter experience is a plus).
  * **Web testing** for **Angular** apps.
  * **Playwright** (TypeScript/JS) for UI & API tests.
  * **REST API** testing with Postman/Bruno; data validation against **Firestore** and **MongoDB**.
  * **k6** performance testing (creating scenarios, interpreting results).
  * Hands-on with **Jira** and **GitHub Actions** (or similar CI).
  * Strong **test documentation** skills (test cases, plans, clear repro steps).
  * High **autonomy** in ambiguous situations; crisp communication.

  
**Nice to have**

  * Experience validating analytics events and crash reports (Sentry/Crashlytics).
  * Firebase auth/security rules basics; GCP familiarity.
  * Prior testing of integrations with **Salesforce** , **Microsoft Dynamics** , or other CRMs/ERPs.
  * Familiarity with release pipelines for TestFlight / Play Console / Firebase App Distribution.

  
**How we work**

  * **Remote-first** , collaborating across product, design, and engineering.
  * Pragmatic, outcomes-driven quality: automate the high-leverage parts, document the rest, and keep shipping.

Here at PlayWorks we deliver fun, high-quality games and apps direct to Smart
TVs everywhere. PlayWorks is a pioneering Post App Store Games company with
games on Instant Messaging apps and Connected TV devices. We have hundreds of
games deployed with various partners such as Facebook, Samsung, LG, Comcast,
Dish, etc. We are a UK-owned company with offices in London, Tel-Aviv, and
Kyiv.  
  
Unlike most quality assurance engineers that test the same functionalities
every day, our testers never get bored and are constantly challenged to bring
the best products to users. We have lots of games, so our job is fun,
interesting, and requires creativity and not a standard approach. Your ideas
are always welcome! Maybe, it will be you who will advise some new game that
will be played by thousands of people!

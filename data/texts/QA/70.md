### ABOUT CLIENT

A dynamic wellness tech venture offering innovative tools to support proactive
health management. Its primary product is a smart scale equipped with cutting-
edge BIA technology, delivering precise data on key body metrics such as fat
percentage, lean mass, and hydration. By merging advanced engineering with a
seamless digital experience, it empowers users to make informed decisions
about their health.

### PROJECT TECH STACK

Flutter, Dart, RESTful APIs

### PROJECT STAGE

live product.

### REQUIREMENTS

  * 2 + years in QA with strong manual testing for mobile and/or web products.
  * Practical/Theoretical experience testing Flutter apps (Android/iOS), including installing local builds, switching flavors, capturing logs, and validating platform-specific behaviors (permissions, deep links, push).
  * Knowledge of common test design techniques.
  * Familiar with API validation (Postman/Insomnia) and basic SQL for read-only verification.
  * Familiar with agile methodologies, STLC/SDLC process.
  * Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and excellent documentation & communication.
  * Ability to test on real devices and simulators/emulators; confident with browser DevTools and device logs.
  * English â€” B2+ or higher

### NICE TO HAVE

  * Exposure to have experience with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), wearables/IoT, or health-tech workflows will be a plus.
  * Understanding of biometric/physiological data considerations (latency, sampling, privacy) will be a plus.
  * Practical performance sanity checks using built-in tools.
  * Familiarity with AI/ML feature validation principles (determinism, guardrails).
  * Awareness of HIPAA/privacy testing considerations and secure data handling.
  * Ability to run existing automation scripts (e.g., Flutter integration_test, Appium) is a plus, not a requirement.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

  * Plan and execute manual test cases for iOS/Android (native & Flutter) and modern web.
  * Perform end-to-end, regression, smoke, and exploratory testing across features like onboarding, auth, data visualization, and edge/offline flows.
  * Verify BLE connectivity scenarios (pairing, reconnection, permissions) using guidance, device logs, and simulators/emulators.
  * Validate API/UI behavior using tools like Postman and browser devtools; perform light database checks (read-only/SQL basics).
  * Reproduce, isolate, and report defects, risk assessment.
  * Collaborate with PM/Design/Engineering to refine acceptance criteria, ensure testability, and surface risks early.
  * Participate in release readiness: build verification, environment checks, and compatibility testing (OS/device/browser matrix).
  * Track and improve quality signals (defect leakage, test coverage, flaky areas, time-to-reproduce).

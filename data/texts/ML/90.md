### About Us

CareerSwift is an AI-powered career automation platform helping job seekers
land their dream roles faster through smart resume building, LinkedIn
optimization, interview practice, and now — an agentic infrastructure built on
top of LLMs.

We’re expanding our stack beyond the Vercel AI SDK and are looking for someone
who deeply understands **LangChain, vector databases, and production-level RAG
systems** to help us scale faster and smarter.

### What You’ll Work On

  * Lead the migration of our AI layer from Vercel AI SDK to **LangChain (TypeScript)**.
  * Design and implement **agentic workflows** that handle resume optimization, job matching, and auto-apply pipelines.
  * Build scalable **RAG systems** for user-specific retrieval and knowledge augmentation.
  * Integrate **Convex or alternative vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate)** for efficient embeddings search.
  * Optimize **LLM performance and cost-efficiency** , and ensure smooth multi-model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).
  * Collaborate with the core engineering team on **Next.js 15 / Vercel / Convex** stack.
  * Optionally, experiment with **LangSmith, MCP, and agent orchestration** for real-time decision-making.

### What We’re Looking For

  * 3+ years of experience in software engineering (preferably backend or AI systems).
  * Strong proficiency in **TypeScript / Node.js / Next.js**.
  * Proven experience with **LangChain, RAG, or vector DBs** in production.
  * Understanding of **LLM orchestration, embeddings, and agentic architecture**.
  * Familiarity with **OpenAI API, Vercel AI SDK, or similar frameworks**.
  * Ability to architect and optimize pipelines for real-world use cases.
  * Self-driven, startup-minded, and able to work asynchronously in a small distributed team.

`Next.js 15` · `TypeScript` · `LangChain` · `Convex` · `Vercel AI SDK` ·
`OpenAI API` · `PostHog` · `Stripe` · `Vector Databases (Pinecone / Qdrant)`

### Bonus Points

  * Experience with **LangSmith or LangServe**.
  * Understanding of **RAG evaluation, embeddings optimization** , and **multi-agent flows**.
  * Interest in **AI products** , SaaS, or career automation tools.

### Why Join

You’ll be part of a fast-growing startup where decisions are fast, ideas
matter, and your code directly impacts thousands of job seekers worldwide.

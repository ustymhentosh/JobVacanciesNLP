**About us:**

We’re building a modern, AI-first CRM for recruiting. True greenfield with
rapid iterations and real ownership. Goal: MVP in ~60 days, harden for scale
by Day 90. You’ll be the cornerstone engineering hire working directly with
the founder.

**Why this role:**

  * Massive ownership: set the technical direction and standards from day one.
  * Real product impact: ship AI features that recruiters use daily (search, summaries, matching, automations).
  * Founding-level equity and a fast path to Head of Engineering / early CTO.

  
**What you’ll do:**

  * Own the architecture for a secure, multi-tenant SaaS, choosing a managed-first platform (e.g., Vercel/Cloudflare/[Fly.io/Render](http://Fly.io/Render) or AWS/GCP/Azure) that balances speed, reliability, and cost for a small team.
  * Build end-to-end: TypeScript/React app, APIs, data models, background jobs, and real-time features.
  * Ship AI capabilities: RAG search, entity dedupe/matching, summarization, recommendations—designed with evals, guardrails, and cost/latency budgets.
  * Establish engineering standards: testing, code conventions, CI/CD, feature flags, observability, RBAC, audit trails, data privacy (consent/DNC, export/delete).
  * Collaborate & lead: translate product goals into technical plans and help hire/mentor 3–6 engineers as we scale.

  
**What you’ll need (skills & experience):**

  * 3++ years building and shipping SaaS with significant 0→1 ownership.
  * Strong React + TypeScript and modern API design; comfortable with relational data modeling, transactions, and indexing.
  * Practical LLM integration: embeddings/RAG, tool-calling/structured outputs, streaming UIs; you can weigh model quality vs. latency vs. cost.
  * Background processing: designing idempotent jobs, retries, schedules, and event-driven workflows.
  * Security & privacy mindset: role-based access, least privilege, auditability, and basic threat modeling.
  * Product sense & communication: you can clarify scope, trade-offs, and deliver shippable increments quickly.
  * Tooling you’ll actually use (illustrative, or equivalent)
  * Web app & APIs: Next.js/React + TypeScript for UI and server routes; tRPC or REST/GraphQL for typed contracts.
  * Data: Postgres (Neon/Supabase/Cloud SQL/Aurora) + Prisma ORM; pgvector for semantic search; Redis (Upstash/managed Valkey) for cache/queues; object storage (S3/R2).
  * AI: OpenAI / Anthropic / Google (plus OSS where it fits) via Vercel AI SDK/direct SDKs; LangGraph/LangChain/OpenAI Assistants for agentic flows where appropriate.
  * Prompt Ops & evals: Langfuse (prompt/version registry & tracing),
  * Helicone/Promptfoo/RAGAS/DeepEval for quality & cost metrics.
  * Background & orchestration: Inngest/[Trigger.dev](http://Trigger.dev) or Temporal; platform crons (Cloudflare/Vercel/EventBridge/Cloud Scheduler).
  * Observability: OpenTelemetry traces + Sentry/Datadog/Grafana Cloud logs/dashboards.
  * Delivery: GitHub Actions CI/CD, per-PR previews; GrowthBook/Unleash feature flags/A-B tests.
  * Auth & enterprise: Auth.js/Clerk/Stytch for auth; WorkOS/Okta for SSO/SAML when needed.
  * Comms integrations: Resend/Postmark/Mailgun (email), Twilio/MessageBird (SMS), Google/Microsoft Graph (calendar).
  * AI-accelerated dev: Cursor, Claude, Copilot/Cody—used deliberately with human-in-the-loop reviews.

  
**Outcomes that define success (30 / 60 / 90)**

**Day 30**

  * Architecture doc + lightweight threat model with platform choice rationale.
  * Monorepo scaffold (Turborepo/pnpm, Biome/lint) + CI (GitHub Actions).
  * Auth/roles live; first UI flows (companies/contacts); seeded Postgres/Prisma.
  * Baseline AI: embeddings pipeline + eval harness wired into Langfuse; initial traces and cost/latency dashboard.

**Day 60 (MVP)**

  * Usable CRM: companies, contacts, pipeline, notes/tasks, saved views/search.
  * Email/SMS I/O and unified activity timeline; background jobs running in prod.
  * AI V1: RAG search, dedupe/matching, meeting/email summaries; eval dashboards and budget guards.

**Day 90**

  * Hardening: SLOs/alerts, audit logging, DR/backups (PITR), performance pass.
  * First automations (auto-enrich → routing/sequences).
  * Prompt versioning & A/Bs, red-team tests (injection/PII), model fallback/traffic splitting.

  
**Nice to have**

  * CRM/ERP domain; deliverability and calendar integrations; analytics (PostHog/Segment).
  * SOC2/GDPR exposure; incident response basics.
  * Team-lead experience (mentoring, hiring loop, leveling).

  
**Compensation & equity**

  * Competitive salary + 5–10% founding-level equity
  * Milestone bonuses tied to Day-60/90 deliverables.
  * Change-of-control protection and refreshers at next financing.

****

**How we work**

  * Small, senior, high-trust team; short cycles, small diffs, preview-before-merge.
  * AI-accelerated dev, measured by quality, safety, and cost—not just speed.
  * Security by default and data privacy from day one.

Intro chat → Systems/product deep-dive → Practical pairing or time-boxed take-
home (≤3 hours) → Founder loop → Offer.

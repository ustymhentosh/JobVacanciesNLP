We’re looking for a hands-on **AI / Data Scientist** who enjoys solving
complex problems with data and turning insights into impactful solutions. In
this role, you’ll work on designing, building, and deploying models that
extract intelligence from large-scale, heterogeneous datasets — including
network, behavioral, and textual data. You’ll collaborate closely with AI
engineers, developers, and security experts to shape features, pipelines, and
analytical tools that make the internet a safer place.

### **Key Responsibilities:**

  * Manipulate, clean, and transform complex, high-volume datasets for modeling and analysis
  * Design and implement feature engineering strategies that enhance model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness
  * Build and evaluate machine learning models for **anomaly detection, fraud identification, forecasting, and optimization**
  * Explore and prototype solutions using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)** and **SQL**
  * Translate product or business requirements into clear analytical tasks and model development plans
  * Contribute to **MLOps workflows** for model deployment, validation, and continuous monitoring
  * Conduct error analysis and model tuning to ensure reliability and efficiency

### **Main requirements:**

  * 1+ years of hands-on experience in DS/ ML
  * Strong proficiency in Python and data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
  * Proven ability to handle messy, large-scale, and multi-source data
  * English: **Upper-Intermediate+** , both written and spoken
  * Experience with classical machine learning algorithms and a solid understanding of their strengths and limitations
  * Familiarity with NLP techniques and modern deep learning approaches
  * Strong analytical mindset and ability to develop well-justified, data-driven solutions
  * Good command of SQL for data querying and preparation

### **The benefits you will get:**

  * Ability to influence processes and best practices
  * Opportunity to expand your technical background
  * Long-term cooperation with teammates and clients
  * Compensation of internal and external English language training
  * Flexible schedule
  * Paid vacation and sick leave
  * Our accountants will take care of the taxes
  * Legal support

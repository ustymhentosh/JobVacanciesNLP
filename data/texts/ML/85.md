We are looking for a Senior AI/ML Engineer to join a fast-growing US-based AI
startup that is building a next-generation data intelligence platform. The
product transforms large volumes of unstructured data into structured,
actionable insights through applied machine learning, GPU compute, and
automated pipelines.

You’ll work closely with the CTO and a Data Engineer to design and build the
platform’s core AI capabilities — from data ingestion and transformation to ML
model deployment and observability. This role is ideal for someone who thrives
in early-stage environments, enjoys hands-on experimentation, and wants to
shape an AI-driven product from the ground up.

**Client** — a rapidly growing US-based AI startup developing a cutting-edge
data intelligence platform that leverages machine learning, GPU computation,
and automation to help organizations extract insights from unstructured data
at scale.

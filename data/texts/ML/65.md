### What is the project, and why should you care?

Symphony Solutions is a Cloud- and AI-driven IT company headquartered in the
Netherlands. We deliver tailored software solutions across Healthcare,
Wellbeing, Airline, and other industries. Since 2008, we’ve been providing
full-cycle software development, data and analytics, cloud engineering, ML &
data engineering service, full-cycle development of AI solutions, and digital
marketing orchestration for clients across Western Europe and North America.

Our solution is one of Symphony’s most innovative projects — an AI-powered
personal intelligence platform that acts as a digital twin and “second brain.”
It combines Voice services, multi-agents, external memory architecture, and
LLM fine-tuning to simplify complex digital interactions and provide
personalized insights for users.

As the AI Solution Architect, you’ll play a pivotal role in designing the
platform’s technical and AI foundations, ensuring its security, scalability,
reliability, and intelligence.

### You will be an excellent fit for this position if you have:

**Core Experience:**

  * 7+ years of experience in software development (Python, Kotlin, Java, or C#), including 2+ years in solution or AI architecture.
  * Proven track record in AI/ML system design, integrating speech recognition (Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Speech to Speech), NLP, and contextual search, development of Gen-AI-based solutions, including RAG, LLM fine-tuning, and real-time speech handling.
  * Experience leading cross-functional teams (AI, data, mobile, and backend engineers).
  * Deep understanding of mobile and cloud integration patterns.
  * Familiarity with Agile/Lean delivery and startup-like MVP development environments.

**Architecture & Cloud Proficiency**

  * Expertise in GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Firestore, BigQuery ML, Serverless, Firebase and Postgres); AWS and Azure also acceptable.
  * Strong grasp of microservice, event-driven, and serverless architectures.
  * CI/CD, containerization, and observability experience (GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana), experience working with vector and graph databases.
  * Experience implementing privacy-first AI architectures (GDPR-compliant data storage, anonymization, zero-knowledge).

**AI & GenAI Expertise**

  * Practical understanding of LLMs, LLM fine-tuning, RAG, multi-modality, Agentic AI, and Multi-agent architecture.
  * Hands-on experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or AutoGen for model orchestration.
  * Knowledge of vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and contextual memory design.
  * Familiarity with speech-to-text and TTS models (Whisper, Azure Cognitive Services, ElevenLabs).
  * Understanding of prompt engineering, meta prompting, and evaluation frameworks (TruLens, Vertex Evals).
  * Awareness of AI trust, explainability, and bias mitigation practices.

**Data Systems & Engineering**

  * Experience with data ingestion and transformation pipelines (Airflow, Kafka, Spark).
  * Familiarity with embedding-based search systems and knowledge graph structures.
  * Understanding of semantic memory models for personal assistant applications.

**Soft Skills**

  * Excellent stakeholder communication and technical storytelling.
  * Consulting mindset — ability to shape technical vision based on evolving business goals.
  * Capable of leading AI discovery workshops, technical PoCs, and pre-sales solution design.
  * Collaborative leadership, inspiring innovation and ownership across the team.

**Preferred Qualifications**

  * Master’s degree in Computer Science, AI, or Data Engineering.
  * Nice to have certifications: AWS ML Specialty, Google ML Engineer, or Cloud Architect (any platform).
  * Previous experience designing AI-first consumer or voice-based applications.
  * Strong understanding of AI governance, trust, and responsible AI principles.
  * Proven delivery record in AI companion or context-aware assistant projects.

### Here are some of the things you’ll be working on:

**Mission**

  * Define and drive the AI architecture and technical direction for the platform.
  * Transform business goals (e.g., digital twin, second brain, contextual AI) into scalable and production-ready solutions.
  * Collaborate with Product Owner, Delivery Manager, and AI engineers to align strategy, feasibility, and innovation.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Architect end-to-end architecture and design of the application, including its components: mobile apps, real-time voice handling, AI agents, and cloud infra services.
  * Design agentic orchestration pipelines that allow autonomous collaboration between AI agents.
  * Oversee the integration of LLMs, embeddings, vectors, networks, and other databases into the core memory framework.
  * Define data privacy and ethical AI guidelines for the product.
  * Support PoC and MVP phases, validating approaches for multimodal (voice/text) interactions.
  * Mentor engineering teams in AI-first architecture and MLOps/LLMOps best practices.
  * Lead technical feasibility assessments and manage trade-offs between innovation and scalability.
  * Collaborate on AI roadmap evolution toward a fully personalized, on-device digital twin.

**Expected Results**

  * Deliver a robust AI architecture blueprint.
  * Co-led the Agentic Orchestration Layer design and deployment for internal and production use.
  * Implement end-to-end LLM evaluation & monitoring within 6 months of MVP launch.
  * Enable continuous learning and improvement loops across AI components (speech, memory, reasoning).

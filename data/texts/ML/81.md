As a **Generative AI & Creative Systems Specialist**, you will design,
orchestrate, and continuously improve **AI-based creative workflows** for
images, video, and text elements that power MGID’s automated creative
generation ecosystem — including tools used directly by clients within the
platform.

Your mission is to **turn creative vision into structured, scalable systems**
that consistently deliver high-quality, compliant, and performance-ready
outputs — not just one-off manual results.

You’ll work closely with the **R &D Creative Team** (AI Expert, Creative
Designer, Creative Manager, and Team Lead) to ensure AI-generated content
aligns with campaign goals, brand identity, and compliance standards. You will
bridge **creative intent and technical implementation** , shaping how AI
supports every stage of the creative process.

### **What You’ll Do**

  * **Design and maintain scalable AI workflows** for image, video, and text generation within MGID’s creative ecosystem.
  * **Develop prompt architectures and orchestration logic** that connect multiple AI agents (e.g., image generation, title generation, creative scoring).
  * **Use n8n to build and automate creative workflows** , helping test AI outputs faster, organize prompt experiments, and reduce repetitive manual steps during generation or review.
  * Experiment with and refine **prompt strategies** , **model setups** , and **multi-model combinations** to achieve stable, category-relevant outputs.
  * **Select and evaluate AI models** (text, image, video) for each use case, balancing quality, latency, and cost.
  * Apply or adapt **fine-tuned or LoRA-based models** to improve realism, style consistency, or brand fidelity.
  * Review generation outputs for **usability, compliance, and safety** (e.g., readability, NSFW filtering, brand adherence).
  * Build **reusable prompt templates, patterns, and creative logic** to accelerate iteration and maintain consistent quality.
  * Collaborate with backend developers to **define API prompt structures** , input-output formats, and system prompt hierarchies for integration into MGID’s creative tools.
  * Occasionally prototype **lightweight utilities or scripts** (e.g., Colab flows, Python snippets, Chrome extensions) to validate new generation flows before full implementation.
  * Document workflows clearly and communicate decisions to both technical and creative peers.

### **Who You Are**

  * You have **hands-on experience** working with AI-driven creative workflows (typically 2+ years, or proven real-world portfolio).
  * You understand **prompt design** across text, image, and video — including image-to-image, control flows, or text-to-video techniques.
  * You think in **systems and dependencies** , building repeatable creative flows rather than isolated outputs.
  * You are familiar with **fine-tuning concepts, dataset preparation, and LoRA adaptations** , and can work with or adjust existing models when needed.
  * You have experience with **Stable Diffusion / SDXL, Flux, Kling, Minimax, Runway, OpenAI** , or similar multimodal systems.
  * You can analyze and explain **model behavior, quality trade-offs, and best-fit scenarios** for each creative task.
  * You are comfortable collaborating with both **creative and technical teams** , translating between design goals and system logic.
  * You can explain **how and why** a specific AI setup achieves the desired result — and iterate effectively when it doesn’t.
  * You are proactive, organized, and thrive in a fast-paced, experimental R&D environment.
  * Your English is **Intermediate+** , sufficient for documentation and cross-team communication.

### **Nice to have**

  * Experience working with **APIs** , **Python scripting** , or **automation tools** (e.g., n8n, Colab).
  * Familiarity with **SQL queries** and **basic database structures** (e.g., understanding how creative data or generation logs are stored and accessed).
  * Experience working in **AdTech or MarTech** environments.
  * Basic knowledge of **HTML** and front-end data handling principles.
  * Familiar with **Cursor** , **Claude Code** , or similar AI-assisted development tools for creating internal utilities, workflow prototypes, or lightweight automation apps.
  * Understanding of **prompt orchestration frameworks** (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom agent pipelines).

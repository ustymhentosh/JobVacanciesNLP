We are expanding our team and looking for a **Prompt Engineer** to join our
RnD department. You will be responsible for designing, testing, and optimizing
**prompts for existing Large Language Models (LLMs)** that process large
volumes of **text and audio data**. These models are used for summarization,
prioritization, tone analysis, and extracting key information.

The role involves **analyzing dataset outputs, identifying failure cases,
refining prompts** , and quickly iterating based on internal feedback and
testing. Optionally, you may work with **Python or PHP scripts** to support
dataset exploration and evaluation.

**Who We Are**

Our **RnD department** is a key driver of innovation in the company,
consisting of ten teams that develop **CRM, marketing tools, CMS, payment
solutions, and internal systems**. With a strong focus on **automation,
performance, and scalability** , we create solutions that enhance efficiency
across multiple business units.

**Why Join Us?**

  * You’ll work directly with **LLM-powered systems** that automate summarization, classification, and prioritization tasks across high-volume content flows.
  * You’ll be part of a process where **prompt design directly impacts product output and user experience**.
  * You’ll collaborate with a **highly skilled RnD team** — including developers, analysts, QA, DevOps, and product managers.
  * We promote **experimentation, knowledge sharing** , and give you the freedom to test new ideas and approaches.
  * If you enjoy working with AI tools and want to make them smarter and more reliable—this role is for you!

**Requirements**

**Must-Have:**

  * **1+ year** of hands-on experience with **LLMs** like **ChatGPT, Claude** , or similar frameworks.
  * **2+ years** of experience in a technical or analytical role (e.g. **technical writer, analyst, QA, developer**).
  * Understanding of how **GPT-style models behave and fail** in real-world usage.
  * Experience with **SQL/PostgreSQL** and data querying.
  * Ability to **read, build, and debug** scripts on **Python or PHP**.
  * Strong **logical thinking** and excellent **written communication** skills.

**Nice-to-Have:**

  * Completed a **course** or built a **practical project** in **prompt design** or **LLM application**.
  * Familiarity with **prompt-based agents** or **RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)** architectures.

**Responsibilities**

  * Analyze business tasks and develop high-quality **prompts for LLMs** that handle summarization, prioritization, data extraction, and tone adjustment.
  * Work with text and audio datasets, chunk datasets, test prompt variations and **iterate based on results and team feedback**.
  * Perform **data analysis** at scale, optionally using **Python** scripts for support.
  * Collaborate with developers, analysts, and product managers to **deploy and evaluate LLM-based tools**.
  * Research and document **LLM behavior, limitations, and failure patterns** to improve prompt strategies.
  * Ensure prompt outputs are accurate, consistent, and aligned with project goals.

**Benefits**

  * **18 business days of paid vacation** \+ public holidays compensation.
  * **Insurance Fund** of the company.
  * **Partial coverage** of all professional studies.
  * **Coverage of sick leaves, sports activities, and English language courses.**

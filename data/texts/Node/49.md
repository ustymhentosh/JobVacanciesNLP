**About us:**  
At **MezePay** , we’re revolutionizing how restaurants in Greece operate. From
seamless QR-based menus and ordering systems to modern, cloud-first POS
solutions, we empower hospitality businesses with tools built for the digital
era. We’re a fast-growing startup on a mission to bring simplicity, speed, and
efficiency to the traditional restaurant experience- one taverna at a time.

**About the role:**  
We’re looking for a skilled **Backend Engineer** to join our founding
engineering team and help build the backbone of MezePay’s restaurant platform.
You’ll design and develop secure, scalable backend systems and APIs that power
our customer-facing apps and restaurant operations — from ordering and
payments to analytics and delivery integrations.

**Main responsibilities:**  
You will be a key contributor in designing and building the core of our
product:

  * Design, implement, and maintain RESTful APIs and backend services (Orders, Menus, Payments, etc.).
  * Architect secure, high-performing, and scalable systems following modern best practices.
  * Integrate with third-party systems such as payment gateways and delivery platforms.
  * Write clean, testable, and well-documented code.
  * Participate in code reviews, technical design sessions, and sprint planning.
  * Ensure uptime, reliability, and smooth operation of all backend services.

**Your experience:**  
We would expect you to have:

  * 3+ years of experience in backend development, ideally in startups or fast-paced environments.
  * Strong proficiency with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** (or similar modern backend languages).
  * Experience with **PostgreSQL** , **Redis** , or other SQL/NoSQL databases.
  * Familiarity with containerization (**Docker**) and CI/CD pipelines.
  * A passion for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
  * **Bonus:** Experience with POS systems, payments, or hospitality tech.

**Nice to have:**

  * GraphQL or gRPC API development.
  * Experience with Kafka or other event-driven architectures.
  * Exposure to Firebase, Supabase, or other Backend-as-a-Service platforms.
  * Familiarity with DevOps or Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform.

**What’s in it for you?**

  * Work directly with the customer, in a culture of ownership and impact.
  * Be part of the **founding engineering team** , shaping the product from the ground up.
  * Work on technology that directly impacts small businesses across Greece.
  * Opportunity to grow into **Tech Lead** or **Engineering Manager** roles as we scale.
  * 20 fully paid vacation days.
  * 15 fully paid sick leaves.
  * Paid public holidays.
  * Compensation for **health insurance** and **sports club membership** (after trial period).
  * Hybrid and remote work flexibility.

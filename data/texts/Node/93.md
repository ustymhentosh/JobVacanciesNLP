Backend Lead Developer — Event-Driven Platform  
  
About the Role  
Our client is building the next-generation investment platform to redefine how
financial  
products are created, managed, and operated — from idea generation to issuance
and  
redemption. At the core is a modular and scalable architecture powered by  
decentralized services and an event-driven design.

  
Key Responsibilities:  
• Design and implement a decentralized, event-driven service architecture.  
• Develop on our cloud-native Azure stack using Node.js / TypeScript.  
• Build atomic services that react to business events and support parallel
task  
execution.  
• Integrate AI agents for automation and coding acceleration.

  
Your Profile:  
• This role requires a hands-on approach to software development, including  
architectural design and active coding.  
• Expert in Node.js / TypeScript on a cloud-native stack (preferably Azure).  
• Strong background in service- and event-driven architecture.  
• Bonus: Knowledge of financial products or the structured product lifecycle.  
Your Tasks  
• Deliver an architectural blueprint based on TypeScript/Node.js on our cloud-  
native infrastructure (Azure). This architecture aligns with our long-term  
platform vision.  
• Implement the first use case, which is already available as PoC, based on
the  
chosen architectural blueprint.  
• Provide technical leadership to a small development team in implementing  
additional business cases.

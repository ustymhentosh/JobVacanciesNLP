### **About us**

We’re a **Ukrainian startup** building a new generation of **route-
optimization and delivery-automation tools** for couriers, drivers, and
service businesses.

Our vision — transform chaotic, inefficient deliveries into a **seamless,
intelligent ecosystem** for both individuals and companies.

Now building a scalable, production-grade product from scratch — the
foundation for future B2B ecosystem

We’re looking for a **Senior Backend Engineer** to **lead the backend
direction** and help architect the foundation for a system designed to scale
from thousands to millions of users.

### **Your role**

Lead backend architecture for a next-generation mobile app that will scale to
millions of users. Work directly with the founder to design the system’s
architecture, performance, and scalability.

### **What you’ll do**

  * Architect and implement backend systems using **Node.js (NestJS)**
  * Design scalable data models with **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**
  * Build a modular, high-performance backend ready for multi-service expansion
  * Develop containerized infrastructure (**Docker + Kubernetes**)
  * Take part in the configuration and management of **AWS** environments (ECS/Lambda, S3, RDS, CloudWatch)
  * Collaborate with mobile developers for seamless API integration
  * Optimize performance, scalability, and fault tolerance

### **Required skills**

  * **4+ years** of backend development with **Node.js / TypeScript**
  * Expertise with **NestJS** and microservice or monolithic architecture
  * Proficiency in **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** (schema design, indexing, scaling)
  * Experience building **distributed, high-load systems**
  * Strong understanding of **AWS** (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, IAM)
  * Hands-on with **Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD**
  * Knowledge of cloud-native design and horizontal scalability
  * Strong ownership and independent decision-making

### **Nice to have**

  * Event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
  * Real-time data flows (WebSockets, Pub/Sub, Firebase)
  * Clean architecture patterns

### **Soft skills**

  * Strong technical leadership and architectural thinking
  * Clear communication and collaboration
  * Proactive problem-solving approach
  * Ability to work independently in a startup environment

### **What we offer**

  * Core role from day one — shape the entire backend system
  * Half autonomy to architect, experiment, and define standards
  * Long-term collaboration and meaningful technical growth
  * Direct work with the founder, product, and design
  * Remote-first, async-friendly, zero bureaucracy

challenging backend project.

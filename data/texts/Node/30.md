a powerful, user-facing product.

We’re hiring a **Senior Full Stack Engineer (Backend-focused)** to play a

  * Troubleshoot and fix tricky backend and API issues across different environments to keep things running smoothly.
  * Help us improve by suggesting better tools, new tech, or smarter architecture to reduce technical debt and speed things up.
  * Work with our DevOps team to shape the infrastructure, improve CI/CD pipelines, and strengthen our monitoring and logging.
  * Collaborate closely with Product and Marketing on planning and estimates, and team up with Frontend, QA, and others to deliver great features — occasionally jumping into frontend code (Next.js, Tailwind).
  * Keep our codebase clean through thoughtful code reviews, clear documentation, and solid engineering practices.
  * Join in on system planning, find ways to improve how we work, and contribute to broader company goals.
  * Mentor junior engineers, give constructive feedback, and share your knowledge on design and best practices.

**About you:**

  * High proficiency in Typescript and Javascript, with a strong command of modern backend development.
  * Demonstrates deep expertise in Nest.js and Postgres, including strong SQL skills and practical experience working with ORMs.
  * Solid understanding of architectural patterns like distributed systems and event-based architecture.
  * Foundational to intermediate knowledge of frontend technologies, specifically React, CSS, Next.js, and Tailwind.
  * Upper-Intermediate level of English; Fluent Ukrainian
  * Natural curiosity about technology, constantly exploring new libraries, tools, and trends in the tech world.
  * Passion for learning and experimentation, often working on personal projects outside of core work responsibilities.

**Will be a plus:**

  * Experience with AI tools integrations
  * Working with tracing tools, like LangFuse, LangChain, etc.
  * Understanding front-end best practices

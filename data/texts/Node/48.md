  * **Backend (Node.js/TypeScript):** design and implement highly available microservices and APIs, own data modeling and storage, and ensure reliability, observability, and security.
  * **Video & data pipelines:** design scalable ingest/transcode/distribution flows; integrate AI/ML services to power content transformations and recommendations.
  * **Platform & ops:** automate infra, CI/CD, and monitoring; drive quality via code reviews, tests, and instrumentation.

### What you’ll bring

  * **5+ years** professional experience in full-stack or backend development.
  * **3+ years** building Node.js backend systems (TypeScript preferred).
  * **3+ years** with modern frontend frameworks (**React/TypeScript** ; Next.js a plus).
  * Strong CS fundamentals and experience with systems at scale (millions of daily users).
  * Proven track record taking services from architecture → development → testing → deployment → monitoring.
  * Hands-on with **RDBMS and NoSQL** (e.g., Postgres/MySQL and MongoDB/Document DB) and understanding their trade-offs.
  * Experience with **message queues/streams** (SQS, Kafka, Kinesis, RabbitMQ, etc.).
  * API design (REST and/or GraphQL), caching (Redis), and performance tuning.
  * Excellent communication, ownership, and a **can-do** attitude; highly independent and collaborative.

### Nice to have

  * Experience building **data and ML pipelines** ; Python for data/ML work.
  * React Native/Expo and mobile performance patterns.
  * Containers & **Kubernetes** , IaC (Terraform), and cloud (AWS/GCP).
  * Video/streaming (FFmpeg, HLS/DASH), CDN performance, media storage.
  * Familiarity with **LLMs** , prompt engineering, agents, and **RAG**.

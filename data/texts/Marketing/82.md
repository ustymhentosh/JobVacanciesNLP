**🌟 Who are we, and what do we aspire to?**

**Liven** is a product company that builds a companion for self-discovery.

We believe that self-discovery is a lifelong journey and want to help people
navigate it every step of the way. That’s why Liven is building a system of
tools to help people compose themselves and grow into who they want to become.

People use Liven to track their mood, process emotions, and untangle thoughts
by chatting with an AI companion. They build new routines with a task planner,
explore how their brain and body react to trauma through personalized courses,
take well-being quizzes, and relax or refocus with soundscapes.

Our goal is to become the most trusted self-discovery companion globally.
Liven is here to define and lead the mental wellbeing category. We aim to earn
global trust by building an ecosystem of context-aware products for self-care
and improvement. Our brand is optimistic and whimsical, yet wise and
practical. We’re Liven! We bring joy back to life!

**💪🏻 What will you enjoy most about being on the Liven team?**

Since 2023, we’ve been scaling non-stop. We’re expanding the product, the team
behind it, and our global reach. Liven has grown a lot since it was just a
team of four. But our priority remains the same: building a vibrant culture
where we share ideas, speedrun through challenges, and shape the business
together.

The Role You’ll Own — Content Manager, someone who can turn complex expert
topics into clear, engaging, and helpful content — from articles and
educational lessons to videos and emotional self-regulation practices.

**🎯 How Will You Make an Impact?**

This role is perfect for someone who enjoys research, loves experimenting with
various content formats, and wants to create materials that genuinely help
people around the world.

Empathy for our audience is key: our product supports people through difficult
life periods, helping them restore inner balance and build healthy
relationships. That’s why we’re looking for someone who can communicate in a
simple, honest, and human way — remembering that every user is a living story,
not just a number in analytics.

**🪶 Your Responsibilities:**

— Create personalized English-language content (lessons, articles, video and
podcast scripts, self-regulation practices, and push notifications);  
— Conduct in-depth research on topics, audiences, and competitor insights;  
— Generate ideas, form and test content hypotheses, and evaluate their impact
on product metrics;  
— Collaborate with external experts to verify the accuracy of materials;  
— Use AI tools to create audio and video content;  
— Prepare technical briefs for designers;  
— Work with internal content systems.

**🧩 What Makes You a Perfect Fit?**

— Experience creating content for English-speaking audiences;  
— English level C1;  
— Strong research and information synthesis skills;  
— Experience using AI tools (such as ElevenLabs, HeyGen, Kling AI, or
similar).

**🌱 Even Better If You Have:**

— Experience creating educational or learning content;  
— Familiarity with tools like Figma, Strapi, Confluence, or Crowdin.

**💡 Why Liven?**

People join Liven to bring to life the aspirations they once only dared to
imagine.

Here’s what we offer to support you personally and professionally while you
grow with us:

— A culture that values your ideas and empowers initiative;  
— A growing team of over 200 passionate professionals;  
— Health insurance, in-house doctor, and massage therapy;  
— Internal professional clubs on marketing, development, payments, customer
experience, and entrepreneurship;  
— Sports and passion clubs: functional training, stretching, yoga, running,
board games, and more;  
— Opportunities for continuous learning and growth;  
— Meaningful work that makes a real impact.

We also fund projects that help overcome the consequences of the war and
contribute to Ukraine’s recovery through the **SKELAR Foundation** , a charity
created and run by our employees.

If you want to shape a product that helps people face challenges, process
emotions, heal from trauma, rebuild a positive self-image, and rediscover joy
— Liven is the place for you!

We are a fast-growing team creating innovative products in the iGaming
industry. We are looking for a Promo CRM Manager to take our gamification and
player segmentation to the next level by implementing impactful retention
campaigns and creative engagement mechanics.

### What You’ll Do:

  * Launch and optimize automated campaigns: triggers, scenarios, and player lifecycle journeys.
  * Manage multi-channel communications: email, web-push, SMS, and in-app messages.
  * Create and implement gamification mechanics in CRM: missions, levels, tournaments, wheels, loot boxes.
  * Develop loyalty programs, bonus mechanics, and promotional campaigns.
  * Implement retention strategies using Smartico or other relevant tools.
  * Run A/B tests to improve OR, CTR, and LTV.
  * Analyze player behavior and segment audiences to increase their long-term value.

### What We Expect:

  * Minimum 2 years of experience in CRM marketing within the iGaming industry.
  * Solid understanding of funnels, gamification, and retention tools.
  * Strong analytical thinking and data-driven mindset.
  * Experience building multi-channel retention campaigns.
  * English — at least Intermediate (B1).
  * Experience with Smartico or [Customer.io](http://Customer.io) is a plus (we are ready to train if you have strong motivation).

### Why This Role Is Exciting:

  * Less routine, more creativity: instead of standard newsletters, you’ll work on engagement mechanics and bring your own ideas to life.
  * Direct impact on the product: your work will directly influence key business metrics — retention, LTV, ARPU.
  * Cutting-edge tools: work with one of the most powerful CRM solutions on the market — Smartico.
  * Small team & fast decision-making: quick approvals, minimal bureaucracy.

### **What we offer:**

  * Time Off. 21 working days of paid vacation, 25 paid sick leave days (no doctor’s note required), and 3 fully paid personal days per year
  * Learning & Development. $600 annual budget for courses, conferences, or mentorship — whatever helps you grow
  * Business Travel. Visits to our main office in Cyprus and international conferences — meet the team in person and stay on top of industry trends
  * Team Culture. Regular team buildings, offsites, and company events — we work hard but also celebrate together
  * Autonomy & Ownership. Transparent processes, no micromanagement — we trust you to take the lead and drive results.

Join YouScan, a leading Ukrainian B2B SaaS company, as our **Global Events
Marketing Manager**!  
  
We’re looking for a proactive, detail-oriented, and highly organized
professional to take full ownership of our global events strategy and its
implementation.

We already participate in and organize a wide range of events — from our own
webinars to offline meetups to sponsored presence at the global industry
conferences. Now we need a teammate who will lead and own this line of work,
ensuring every event drives lead generation, brand awareness and visibility
for YouScan.  
  

**Why we’re opening this role**

Given the scale and strategic importance of events for our growth, we need a
professional who will take full ownership of this line of work — from planning
to execution.  
  
  
**Responsibilities**  
  
You will manage the entire events marketing function across all markets — the
US, the UK, EU, Ukraine, and LATAM — covering online, offline, owned, and
sponsored events.  
  
Your key responsibilities will include:

  * Strategy & Planning: Build and maintain a global events roadmap aligned with our marketing goals and ideal customer profile.
  * Research & Evaluation: Identify new event opportunities (conferences, expos, summits, webinars) that are relevant for YouScan.
  * Execution & Project Management: Manage all event logistics from start to finish — sponsorship negotiations, booth coordination, speaker arrangements, collateral production, internal alignment, deadlines, and budget management.
  * Coordination & Communication: Collaborate with internal teams (marketing, sales, customer success, product) and external partners to ensure seamless execution.
  * Creative Contribution: Bring fresh ideas for how we can make our brand stand out — through booth concepts, speaker participation, interactive formats, and post-event content follow-up.
  * Measurement & Reporting: Track results, analyze metrics, and present insights and recommendations for future events.

Who we’re looking for**  
You’re an organized multitasker who thrives in a dynamic environment and
enjoys turning plans into flawlessly executed experiences. You combine
strategic thinking with operational precision — and you’re comfortable owning
projects from start to finish.

  * Proven ability to manage both online and offline events across multiple regions.

  * High level of professionalism in negotiations, business correspondence, and partner relationship building. 
  * Self-starter with the ability to manage multiple priorities simultaneously.

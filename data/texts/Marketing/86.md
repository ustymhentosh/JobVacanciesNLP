We’re looking for a sharp, proactive **Outbound Strategy Lead** to own
Radency’s outbound engine, turning technical insight into sequences that
convert.

We’re a small, fast-moving team that values clear thinking over bureaucracy.
You’ll have the space to experiment, grow, and make an impact.  
  
♟️ **What You’ll Be Doing**

  * **Own outbound like a product.** From idea to reply to booked call — you’ll shape what we say, who we say it to, and how it evolves over time.
  * **Collaborate with an outbound infrastructure agency.** You’ll work with a partner who manages warm-up, deliverability, rotation, and 100+ inboxes. No babysitting inboxes, just smart execution.
  * **Be the hypothesis machine.** Interview Solution Architects, dig into case studies, and extract insights that become campaign angles. Messaging that earns attention, not just opens.
  * **Design and launch sequences.** Write and iterate campaigns with clear angles and ICP fit. Test. Learn. Refine.
  * **Tier, segment, prioritize.** Structure audiences into Tier 1/2/3 groups and adjust channels, content depth, and personalization accordingly.
  * **Build and enrich lead lists.** Use tools like Apollo, Clay, and Sales Nav to build and validate lists. (We’re also exploring how AI agents can streamline this — you’ll help shape that future.)
  * **Amplify through social selling.** Work closely with our technical experts and marketing team to align outbound messaging with our growing LinkedIn presence. Great posts = great campaigns.
  * **Run with high autonomy.** You’ll have space to lead outbound and to shape our growth.  
  
🎯 **What We Expect**  
  

  * 3+ years in outbound, sales strategy, or growth roles, ideally in B2B tech or SaaS.
  * Strong analytical and messaging skills. You’re as comfortable writing a punchy cold email as you are segmenting by ICP tiers.
  * Hands-on experience with Apollo, Clay, Sales Navigator, and similar tools.
  * Curiosity and initiative, you’re not waiting for someone to tell you what to try next.
  * Comfortable working with prompts, AI tools, and **automation**.
  * Bonus if you’ve ever structured outbound around hypothesis-driven messaging.  
  
  
🏆 **Why Radency**  
  

  * Work with a **highly selective engineering team** : we hire the top 1% of talent through a nationwide training and certification program.
  * Build campaigns for cutting-edge AI and software solutions across SaaS, HealthTech, MarTech, and Geospatial domains.
  * Be part of a company that’s deeply technical, radically efficient, and laser-focused on delivery.
  * Your messaging won’t float in a vacuum, you’ll be plugged into real expertise from delivery partners and Solution Architects.
  * **This could be your launchpad.** Whether you want to grow into growth leadership, AI-powered GTM, or ops — this role gives you space to carve your path.

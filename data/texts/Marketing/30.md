We are building an ambitious iGaming ecosystem and are looking for a Head of
Media Buying to lead and scale our user acquisition function. This is a key
leadership role with full ownership over team building, media strategy, and
operational excellence — the person in this role will shape how we attract,
convert, and grow players across global markets.

### Key Responsibilities:

  * Build and lead a high-performing team. Hire, develop, and mentor media buyers and team leads, set clear goals and priorities, and foster a culture of ownership, experimentation, and collaboration.
  * Scale acquisition and manage budgets. Develop and execute multi-channel media strategies (paid social, search, programmatic, affiliates) with monthly budgets of $X—$Y, ensuring strong ROI/ROAS and payback.
  * Design and optimize processes. Audit the current buying cycle, implement clear workflows and playbooks, streamline planning → creative → buying → optimization → attribution → reporting.
  * Improve operational efficiency. Automate routine processes, ensure conversion deduplication, anti-fraud protection, and brand safety.
  * Drive performance. Launch and scale campaigns focused on achieving target CAC/CPA/FTD/LTV metrics and delivering sustainable user growth.
  * Collaborate cross-functionally. Work closely with product, content, CRM, and BI teams to align offers, landing pages, and retention mechanics.

### What We Expect:

  * 2+ years of experience as Head/Lead of Media Buying and 5–8+ years in performance marketing overall.
  * Proven track record in gambling/iGaming with multi-region campaign management and compliance.
  * Hands-on experience managing large budgets ($X—$Y/month) and scaling campaigns across paid social, search, programmatic/DSP, affiliates, native, and OTT/CTV.
  * Experience building and scaling teams: hiring, setting goals, conducting reviews, and building playbooks.
  * Strong understanding of unit economics, ROI/ROAS, CAC→LTV, and payback principles.
  * Operational expertise: process design, campaign workflows, conversion tracking, risk management, and automation.
  * English level: Upper-Intermediate or higher.

**_Nice-to-have:_**

  * Experience with programmatic platforms (DV360/TTD) and partner networks (CPA/CPL/RevShare).
  * Strong negotiation skills with platforms and networks.
  * Experience operating in regulated markets (EU/UK/US/BR/IN) and managing moderation risks.

### **What we offer:**

  * Time Off. 21 working days of paid vacation, 25 paid sick leave days (no doctor’s note required), and 3 fully paid personal days per year
  * Learning & Development. $600 annual budget for courses, conferences, or mentorship — whatever helps you grow

We are looking for a Project Manager who also feels comfortable acting as a
Business Analyst.

You will drive delivery for a new product initiative with a German
construction company (development of an internal HR system), and in parallel
oversee several smaller outstaff/augmentation engagements to make sure
communication, billing, and delivery run smoothly.

You will be the primary delivery contact on the Edvantis side responsible for
planning, tracking, reporting, financial control, communication, and
stakeholder alignment. You will also work directly with the Client’s domain
experts to collect and refine business requirements. Part of the role includes
on-site discovery in Germany to meet different stakeholder groups, clarify
business processes, and align expectations.

This is a hands-on role: you own delivery quality, team collaboration, client
satisfaction, and overall project health.

### Language requirements:

  * English — Upper-Intermediate or higher
  * German — Upper-Intermediate or higher. Strong spoken communication skills (you will talk to German stakeholders directly)

### Responsibilities:

  * Oversee delivery and project management
  * Ensure stakeholder management and account growth
  * Work on Business Analysis tasks and requirements
  * Lead the team and manage people

  * Ability to go on business trips to the Client in Germany
  * Proven experience running projects from initiation through closure, including planning, backlog management, risk control, reporting, and acceptance of deliverables
  * Demonstrated experience in requirements discovery: running stakeholder interviews, translating business needs into actionable requirements / backlog items, managing change requests
  * Experience with financial aspects of delivery (profitability, rates, margins, invoicing, forecasting)
  * Strong communication, facilitation, and negotiation skills — ability to keep both internal team and client aligned
  * Ability to tailor processes (Scrum / Agile / hybrid) to fit the situation, not just to follow a template
  * Understanding of team motivation, performance management, and conflict resolution

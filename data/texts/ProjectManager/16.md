At **Spendbase** , we’re building an ecosystem that helps companies take
control of their spending — from SaaS and cloud optimization to payments and
cards.

On top of that, we’re launching several new products and need a **Project
Manager** to guide them from idea to launch. We’re looking for someone who
brings clarity and structure, keeps people aligned, and makes sure projects
move forward.

**What you’ll do:**

  * Turn ideas into action: define scope, align teams, push projects to the finish line
  * Run several product initiatives in parallel without losing clarity
  * Keep engineers, designers, and business folks on the same page
  * Spot risks early, solve blockers, and keep momentum high
  * Balance structure with startup speed: keep projects under control without slowing them down

**What we’re looking for:**

  * 2–4 years of running projects in tech/startups (fintech is a plus, but not a must)
  * Clear communicator who can align people and manage expectations
  * Organized and reliable, but flexible when things shift
  * Hands-on and proactive: you don’t just monitor tasks, you make things happen
  * Ability to manage multiple projects and switch contexts quickly
  * English B2+ 

**Why Spendbase:**

  * Work on real fintech products that go global
  * Fast-moving startup with high ownership and autonomy
  * Flat team, quick decisions, visible impact
  * Competitive compensation and growth opportunities****

We are looking for an experienced Project Manager to coordinate the migration
of our legacy Remote Game Server (RGS) platform to a new, modern backend
solution that powers our online slot games.

You’ll oversee a small, agile software team (around 10 members, including
developers, QA) and manage day-to-day planning, scheduling, and delivery

software projects run, especially in backend or platform environments. You’ll
ensure milestones are met, risks are managed, and all stakeholders are aligned
throughout the migration process.

  * Coordinate multiple workstreams (backend, QA, deployment).
  * Drive sprint planning, stand-ups using **Jira**.
  * Maintain clear and up-to-date tracking of all tasks, issues, and risks.
  * Manage a **cross-functional team** of up to 10 members across development, QA.
  * Ensure team members have clear priorities and understand sprint goals.
  * Support collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders.
  * Provide regular **status updates and reports** to leadership and stakeholders.
  * Communicate risks, issues, and changes in scope clearly and early.
  * Align with Product, Compliance, and Operations teams to ensure project readiness.
  * Facilitate discussions between non-technical and technical contributors.
  * Work with QA to plan test cycles and ensure quality gates are met before releases.
  * Coordinate release schedules and ensure post-release follow-up on any issues.
  * Continuously refine project workflows for greater transparency and efficiency.

### Delivery Coordinator (Part‑time or Full‑time)

**Location:** Remote

**About[Starlio.tech](http://Starlio.tech)**  
[Starlio.tech](http://Starlio.tech) is a UK‑based software consultancy with
Ukrainian roots. We build reliable software systems for global clients and
keep delivery simple, transparent, and outcome‑driven.

### Role overview

**Contract:** Initial 2 to 3 month engagement with the possibility of
extension.  
We are hiring a Delivery Coordinator to support day‑to‑day operations across
several client engagements. This role suits someone early in their delivery or
operations career who is hungry to learn, communicates clearly, and takes
ownership. Strong soft skills (commitment, communication, proactivity, problem
solving) matter more to us than long years of experience.

You will help keep projects flowing, prepare client‑ready updates, chase
actions, and use AI tools to research, summarise, and accelerate routine work.
With strong performance, you can grow into an Operations Manager or Delivery
Manager path.

### What you will do

  * Coordinate delivery routines: stand‑ups, weekly status, action items, and follow‑ups.
  * Maintain accurate boards and trackers (Jira) and keep documentation tidy (Confluence/Docs).
  * Prepare concise client updates: scope, schedule, budget, risks, and next steps.
  * Assist with resource scheduling, timesheets, invoices, and change‑request logs.
  * Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for research, note‑taking, meeting summaries, and draft communications.
  * Create and improve simple SOPs, templates, and checklists for repeatable work.
  * Support the Head of Delivery with ad‑hoc operational tasks across multiple projects.
  * Join client calls in English, capture decisions, and make sure follow‑ups happen.

### Must‑have

  * Excellent communication in English (spoken and written).
  * Strong ownership mindset: you notice gaps, propose fixes, and close loops.
  * Proactive and organised; comfortable juggling multiple priorities.
  * Problem‑solving attitude and calm under pressure.
  * Comfortable using AI tools for research, drafting, and summarising.
  * Solid working knowledge of the Atlassian stack, Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides), and Slack.
  * Basic understanding of Agile/Scrum and how delivery teams operate.
  * Ability to work core hours in the Europe/Kyiv timezone.

### What we offer

  * Part‑time start is possible; pathway to increase hours and responsibilities.
  * Mentorship from Head of Delivery and practical growth plan.
  * Real impact: you will ship outcomes, not just tickets.
  * Remote‑first culture with clear processes and direct communication.
  * Learning budget and support for relevant certifications.
  * Competitive compensation aligned with experience and location.

### Career path

  * **Operations track:** Operations Coordinator → Operations Manager.
  * **Delivery track:** Delivery Coordinator → Delivery Manager.

### How to apply

Send your CV plus a short note with:

  1. A 5–7 sentence example of how you kept a project or team on track.
  2. One prompt you used with an AI tool and the outcome it produced.

Weâ€™re looking for a **talented UX Designer** focused on **mobile
applications**. The vacancy is hot!ðŸ”¥

**About the Project**

Weâ€™re building a mobile application for a faith-based community â€” a place
where users can connect with others who share their beliefs, explore inspiring
content, and strengthen their personal faith journey.

From one side, users can engage with their community through a social-style
feed, connect with others, discover new communities, and personalize their
spiritual experience through features like a daily Bible verse, personal
reading reminders, and a faith-based activity schedule.

From the other side, community leaders will be able to communicate directly
with their members â€” posting announcements, sharing event schedules, and
managing information about their community services.

The app will include AI-driven moderation features.

**Role Overview**

You will take the lead in defining the user experience from the ground up. You
will shape how users and community leaders interact within the app, setting
the tone for design, usability, and overall product flow.

Initially, this will be a **full-time role** as you define and refine the
experience. The start â€” **asap**. Over time, as the design foundation is set,
the involvement will scale down to **part-time** and eventually **occasional
design consultations**.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead the end-to-end UX design process for the mobile application.
  * Define user flows for both community members and community leaders.
  * Design intuitive experiences for viewing content, connecting with others, and engaging in personal faith-based activities.
  * Collaborate closely with stakeholders to translate vision and functionality into interactive designs.
  * Create wireframes, prototypes, and design systems for mobile.

**Requirements**

  * Proven experience designing **mobile applications** (not just web interfaces).
  * Strong portfolio demonstrating expertise in **UX flow design** , **user journey mapping** , and **interaction design**.
  * Ability to translate conceptual ideas into polished user experiences.
  * Experience in social or community-driven app design is a big plus.
  * Strong understanding of modern UX principles and best practices.
  * Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
  * A high level of English is required â€” minimum Upper-Intermediate.

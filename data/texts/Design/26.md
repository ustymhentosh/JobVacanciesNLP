### **This job is perfect for you if you want to:**

  * **Build and grow** web-direction. You’ll be the key UI/UX Designer driving the Web experience — improving, scaling, and evolving it with the team.
  * **Work with driven, experienced teammates**. You’ll work side-by-side with specialists from all areas, brainstorming, testing, and constantly exchanging ideas and knowledge.
  * **Experiment boldly**. You’ll generate ideas for A/B testing and quickly see the results of your work in action.

### **What you will do:**

  * Design user flows for the web with a clear focus on conversion uplift.
  * Prepare A/B test design solutions — craft hypotheses, produce variants and analyse funnel impact.
  * Own the end-to-end design lifecycle from concepts and wireframes to interactive prototypes and developer handoff.
  * Collaborate closely with PM, engineers, and analysts to build and optimize funnels and align on iteration priorities.
  * Make data-informed decisions via user research — analyze behavior, extract insights, validate hypotheses, and continuously refine UI/UX.
  * Develop and maintain the design system, streamline design workflows, and apply best-in-class web trends and practices (including high-performing marketing emails).

### **What do you need to join us:**

  * 6+ months of commercial experience as a UI/UX or Product Designer.
  * Proficiency in Figma — from wireframes and prototypes to clean developer handoffs.
  * Understanding of UX/UI principles and interaction design fundamentals (composition, color, typography, hierarchy).
  * Ability to work with data and insights — interpret analytics, validate hypotheses, and iterate designs.
  * Basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator.
  * Strong visual sense and attention to detail.
  * Proactive and self-driven mindset — eager to learn, grow fast, and adapt in a dynamic environment.
  * Intermediate+ English level — comfortable communicating with teammates and stakeholders.
  * Business-oriented approach and openness to feedback.
  * Alignment with the values of our team (more about us — [here](https://bit.ly/Impulse_Presentation)).

or combine these options.

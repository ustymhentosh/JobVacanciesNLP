modernize its digital presence and improve online conversion performance. The
focus is to design and launch a new, data-driven marketing and e-commerce
website while setting up a scalable design system from scratch. The designer

fidelity UI to interactive prototypes and marketing visuals — ensuring a
cohesive, user-focused, and conversion-optimized experience that drives
measurable business results.

### Requirements:

  * Understanding of data-driven design and translating analytics into actionable improvements.
  * Solid collaboration skills with cross-functional teams (marketing, sales, PMs, developers).
  * English: Upper-Intermediate + for daily communication and documentation.

### **Responsibilities:**

  * Design and deliver conversion-oriented website experiences — landing pages, product pages, and marketing funnels optimized for engagement and lead generation.
  * Establish and maintain a scalable design system to ensure visual and functional consistency across the website.
  * Execute the full end-to-end design process: user flows, wireframes, visual design, prototyping, and specification handoff.
  * Integrate data-driven UX optimization using analytics and heat-mapping tools such as Google Analytics, Crazy Egg, or similar.
  * Collaborate closely with PMs, business analysts, and marketing/sales teams to align design direction with business objectives.
  * Conduct usability testing, gather insights, and iterate on designs to enhance conversion and usability.
  * Produce visual and promotional assets (banners, social media graphics, campaign visuals) to support marketing initiatives.
  * Help establish an efficient design process and propose workflow improvements to streamline collaboration across teams.

### **What we offer:**

  * Annual paid vacation of 18 working days.
  * Extra vacation days for long-lasting cooperation.
  * Annual paid sick leave of 10 days.
  * Maternity/Paternity leave.
  * The opportunity for sabbatical leave.

We’re looking for a **strong Middle UI/UX Designer** with a passion for
creating clear, scalable, and technically grounded design solutions.  
You’ll work closely with developers, product owners, and other designers to
bring complex systems and user flows to life — ensuring that every design
decision is intentional, maintainable, and built to grow.

### **Minimum Requirements:**

  * 3–5 years of experience in UI/UX design for digital products or platforms  
Proven ability to own end-to-end design processes — from user flows and
prototypes to pixel-perfect UI and implementation support

  * Deep understanding of UX best practices, usability heuristics, interaction principles and accessibility
  * Experience designing scalable, system-based solutions (components, patterns, templates)
  * Solid grasp of how frontend frameworks render and structure UI — understanding states, constraints, and responsive behavior
  * Strong eye for visual hierarchy, clarity, and consistency across complex interfaces
  * Ability to translate abstract product requirements into clear and actionable design decisions

### **Core Skills:**

  * Expertise in Figma (components, auto layout, variables, variants, prototyping)
  * Experience maintaining and contributing to a design system (tokens, components, documentation, usage patterns)
  * Understanding of component-driven design and how design translates into development
  * Familiarity with frontend concepts such as modularity, responsive layouts, breakpoints, and reusability
  * Ability to document and communicate UX patterns, rationale, and behavior logic clearly for handoff
  * Confident working with complex data-driven interfaces — tables, dashboards, forms, or multi-step workflows

### **Soft Skills:**

  * Analytical thinker who can simplify complexity into intuitive, user-friendly flows
  * Collaborative partner — comfortable working alongside developers, product owners, and other designers
  * Proactive communicator — able to explain design logic and align on technical feasibility early
  * Structured and detail-oriented, balancing creativity with systems thinking
  * Continuous learner who keeps up with evolving design tools, frameworks, and UX trends

### **Bonus Points:**

  * Experience with design tokens, theme configuration, or cross-brand design systems
  * Basic hands-on understanding of HTML, CSS, or component frameworks (Tailwind, React)
  * Familiarity with Storybook documentation or similar component libraries
  * Experience designing expandable functionality — workflows that scale across roles, permissions, or contexts
  * Background in AI-driven interfaces, data visualization, or automation flows

### **Our perks and benefits:**

  * Paid Vacation days: 24 working days
  * Paid Sick days: 15 working days
  * The opportunity to dedicate up to 10% of working hours for self-education and personal development

### **About the Project**

You’ll join an international product team developing a **next-generation
Digital Healthcare / FemTech platform** aimed at supporting women through
different health-related life stages — from hormonal transitions and pregnancy
to everyday wellbeing.

The platform’s purpose is to make **trusted medical guidance instantly
accessible** , removing the long waiting times typical of public healthcare
systems. Users can receive real-time answers from **clinically trained AI
models** , and if needed, **seamlessly connect with licensed clinicians** for
video or chat consultations — all within a single app.

The product combines **AI technology** , **human expertise** , and
**empathetic UX design** , creating a reliable space where women can ask
sensitive questions and receive professional, evidence-based care anytime.

From a technical perspective, the solution is powered by a **modern web-native
stack.**

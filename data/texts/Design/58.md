### About the Role

We’re looking for a skilled and user-driven **Product Designer** who thrives
in product-focused environments (SaaS, tele-health, marketplaces) and knows
how to balance user needs with business goals. You’ll work across the full
design cycle — from research and usability testing to prototyping and polished
UI — contributing to our design system and collaborating with cross-functional
teams to deliver accessible, impactful, and scalable experiences.

### Key Responsibilities:

  * Design and iterate on funnels and CRO hypotheses yourself, and work on landing pages either hands-on or by reviewing the work of other designers.
  * Bring consistency between marketing and product design by aligning visual language, interaction patterns, and design standards across all user touch points.
  * Contribute to product features that directly impact LTV and Retention, and review work from the existing product designer.
  * Create visually engaging and high-performing designs that balance marketing objectives with product usability and accessibility.
  * Leverage product metrics, A/B tests, and user research to evaluate and refine design solutions that drive acquisition, engagement, and retention.
  * Work closely with Product, Marketing, and Engineering to ensure efficient implementation and a smooth design-to-development workflow.
  * Systematize design work into updates to the design system, guidelines, and minimal brand identity assets, ensuring scalability and consistency.

### Expectations:

  * 5+ years of experience as a Product Designer in a product-focused company (SaaS, tele-health, marketplace).
  * Experience collaborating in cross-functional teams, with a track record of successfully managing stakeholder expectations.
  * Strong presentation and communication skills, being able to defend design decisions with evidence and reasoning.
  * Awareness of ethical design principles, heuristics, and accessibility best practices.
  * Engaging, breath-catching designs that account for user needs and business objectives.
  * Proven experience working with and contributing to a design system.
  * Understanding of frontend development basics — you know how to create the most efficient UI and comply with development without sacrificing quality.
  * Understanding of product metrics and experience working with features that impact user acqusition and retention.
  * Experience running usability tests and research.

### What we offer:

  * Autonomy and ownership over your work — no pixel pushing, full involvement in product decisions;
  * A collaborative, product-oriented culture with short feedback loops;
  * Flexible working hours and location;
  * An opportunity to shape a product that has a real, positive impact on people’s lives;
  * Paid vacation (33 days off per year, including public holidays);
  * Paid sick leave (10 working days per year);
  * Paid mental health leave (5 working days per year).

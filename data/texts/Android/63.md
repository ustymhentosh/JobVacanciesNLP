### About the Client

Our customer is a leading provider of onboard retail technology and mobile
solutions for the travel and retail industries. The company designs and builds
digital products that transform how airlines, trains, and retailers manage in-
motion sales, inventory, and customer experiences. We are forming a dedicated
Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) team to build a new cross-platform mobile
application from the ground up — one codebase, two native experiences: iOS and
Android.

You’ll lead a small, highly capable Scrum team (engineers, QA, designer),
collaborate closely with backend and product teams, and establish technical
excellence in the mobile domain.

### Responsibilities

  * Own the architecture and technical roadmap for a new Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) mobile product that powers both iOS and Android.
  * Estimate MVP development and other product phases. 
  * Define clean, modular architecture using modern patterns (Clean Architecture / MVI / MVVM / modularization).
  * Lead and mentor a small cross-functional mobile team; perform code reviews and ensure adherence to best practices.
  * Design and implement shared business logic and platform-specific layers, ensuring native UX and optimal performance.
  * Make key technical decisions on frameworks, libraries, CI/CD tools, and delivery processes.
  * Drive cross-platform UI strategy (Compose Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI integration).
  * Collaborate with backend engineers to define efficient API contracts (REST / GraphQL).
  * Establish and maintain automated build, testing, and release pipelines for Android and iOS.
  * Ensure robust app security, observability, and performance monitoring across both platforms.
  * Promote engineering excellence: documentation, testing culture, DevOps alignment, and continuous improvement.
  * Act as a technical liaison between product management and engineering, translating business goals into scalable mobile solutions.

### Must-Have Skills

  * 7+ years of experience in mobile app development, with at least 3 years in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) 
  * Experience in high-level product estimation and roadmap development.
  * Proven record of delivering production-grade mobile applications for both iOS and Android using KMP.
  * Deep understanding of Kotlin (coroutines, flows, multiplatform libraries, shared data models, serialization).
  * Expertise in Android (Jetpack Compose) and iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) with a strong grasp of platform internals and performance tuning.
  * Experience with device-to-device communication protocols, especially **Bluetooth/BLE**.
  * Strong architectural mindset — experienced in designing scalable, testable, modular architectures.
  * Proficiency with Ktor Client, SQLDelight, or similar for data and networking layers.
  * Experience in offline-first architectures, synchronization logic, and push notifications.
  * Hands-on experience building CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Fastlane, Jenkins) and managing app releases (Play Store, App Store).
  * Solid understanding of security, performance, and offline-first mobile patterns.
  * Demonstrated ability to lead teams, perform technical reviews, and mentor developers.
  * Excellent communication and collaboration skills; comfortable working with international teams.
  * Knowledge of observability stacks (Crashlytics, Firebase, Sentry).
  * Professional fluency in English.
  * Available for business trips to the customer side 

### Would be a plus

  * Experience of mesh networking protocols and device-to-device communication.

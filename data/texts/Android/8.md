We are looking for mid-level (3-7 years) and senior (7+ years) Android
developers to work on our Common Health Android app.

Quick Summary:

  * You will be collaborating with developers from Google to fully migrate Common Health to the Google Health Connect framework ([developer.android.com/...​ess/guides/health-connect](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect)).
  * The most important aspect is the Android component, but the app also includes a back-end component using Django, via AWS. Some experience with Android apps using AWS backends is great, but not required.
  * Full-time and Part-time roles are possible.

All Details:

The Commons Project Foundation
([https://www.thecommonsproject.org](https://www.thecommonsproject.org/)) is a
global tech nonprofit building solutions that empower people to access,
manage, and share their data.

CommonHealth ([www.commonhealth.org](https://www.commonhealth.org)) is our
Android app which helps you collect and manage your personal health data and
share it with the health services, organizations and apps you trust.

You should be able to demonstrate experience in the following:

  * Android app development in Kotlin-bin and React-Native.
  * Deploying releases to the Play Store
  * CI/CD practices via GitHub Actions & Workflows
  * Ability to communicate with Engineering managers in English

If you can show that you’ve worked on an Android app which includes a front-
end that retrieves data from an AWS (or other cloud) backend, this will go a
long way to show you are a good fit.

Additionally, experience in the below fields is a plus:

  * Basic Python development via AWS (together with Django, PostgreSQL)
  * Basic management of AWS ECS, Ephemeral, and Cloudfront modules
  * FHIR and “SMART on FHIR” Electronic Health Record APIs.

Full time and part time remote contracts are available. Payment will be
monthly. The program for which these positions are available is over the next
two years (2025-2026) with possibility for extension. We are most interested
in candidates who are prepared to stay involved for at least the duration of
the program.

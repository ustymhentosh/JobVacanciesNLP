Aristeem [aristeem.com](http://aristeem.com/) is an American IT company with
Ukrainian roots that provides a unified service for running heavy software on
any device for everyday users.

Aristeem is looking for a highly skilled Senior C++ Developer experienced in
Windows graphics capture and real-time video processing. You will design,
optimize, and maintain high-performance capture modules for screen and video
pipelines, working closely with GPU APIs, hardware encoders, and complex
multi-threaded systems.

### **Tech Stack**

C++17/20, WinAPI, COM, DirectX 11/12, DXGI, WGC, D3D11on12, NVENC, AMF, QSV,
Media Foundation, FFmpeg, ETW, PIX, RenderDoc, CMake, MSVC.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Develop and optimize image capture modules using DXGI Desktop Duplication API, Windows Graphics Capture, and fallback methods via GDI/DWM.
  * Work with DirectX 11/12, shared textures, GPU—CPU synchronization, and zero-copy frame transfers.
  * Implement cursor capture, HDR→SDR conversion, scaling, and color correction.
  * Integrate with hardware encoders (NVENC, AMF, QSV) and media pipelines (Media Foundation, FFmpeg).
  * Support multi-monitor setups, HiDPI, and virtual displays (IDD).
  * Ensure optimal performance (≥120 FPS at 4K), resolving bottlenecks and thread race conditions.
  * Develop internal SDK interfaces and logging tools (ETW/WPA).
  * Participate in architectural discussions and code reviews.

### **Requirements**

  * 6+ years of professional experience in C++17/20 development.
  * Deep understanding of WinAPI and COM.
  * Proven experience with DirectX 11/12, DXGI, IDXGIOutputDuplication, and Windows Graphics Capture (WGC).
  * Strong knowledge of multithreading, atomic operations, and GPU/CPU synchronization.
  * Experience with Media Foundation, FFmpeg, or hardware video encoders (NVENC/AMF/QSV).
  * Proficiency in profiling and debugging tools (ETW, PIX, RenderDoc, WPA).
  * Understanding of WDDM, DWM, and Flip Model.
  * Ability to write clean, efficient, and leak-free multi-threaded code.

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience developing virtual displays or Indirect Display Drivers (IDD).
  * Familiarity with zero-copy frame sharing (D3D shared handles, keyed mutex).
  * SIMD optimization (SSE/AVX) for color space and format conversions (e.g., RGBA↔NV12, I420).
  * Knowledge of OBS / obs-studio architecture or plugin development.
  * Experience with streaming systems (WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, HLS).
  * Understanding of H.264/H.265 codecs, bitrates, and latency presets.

### **Personal Qualities**

  * Strong systems thinking and attention to low-level details.
  * Commitment to quality, performance, and stability.
  * Ability to justify technical decisions and collaborate effectively in a team.

### **We offer**

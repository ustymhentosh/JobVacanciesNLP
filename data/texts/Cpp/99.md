### **About the Project**

A decentralized operating system and ecosystem that empowers people with full
control over their digital identity and data. We focus on privacy, security,
and independence by providing tools for secure communication, personal data
storage, and digital ownership â€” all without relying on centralized servers or
corporations.

The project is already in progress, and you will join an experienced team.

**Responsibilities**

  * Design, develop, and maintain core components of an offline Operating System, ensuring performance, reliability, and scalability.
  * Work with multiple programming languages **(C, C++, Rust, Go, or others depending on module requirements).**
  * Implement low-level system functionality: memory management, file systems, process scheduling, and device drivers.
  * Develop secure offline communication protocols and ensure system stability in disconnected environments.
  * Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code aligned with modern engineering practices.
  * Debug, test, and optimize system components across multiple hardware environments.
  * Collaborate with a cross-functional team to deliver complete, production-ready solutions.
  * Research and integrate new technologies, libraries, and approaches to improve OS architecture.
  * Participate in code reviews and help establish best practices for OS development.
  * Prepare technical documentation for internal and external stakeholders.

**Required Skills (Tech Stack)**

  * Systems programming: strong experience with **C, C++, Rust, or Nim.**
  * Operating systems fundamentals: memory management, process scheduling, file systems, inter-process communication (IPC).
  * **Security & cryptography:** encryption, authentication, secure communication protocols.
  * **Linux expertise:** low-level Linux internals, kernel modules, or custom OS builds.
  * Networking: **TCP/IP, peer-to-peer networking, sockets, distributed communication.**
  * Strong problem-solving skills in low-level and distributed environments.

**Nice to Have**

  * **Nim** for performant, Python-like syntax compiled to efficient binaries.
  * **Nix / NixOS:** reproducible builds, package management, declarative infrastructure.
  * **Distributed systems:** consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos), gossip protocols, scalability.
  * **Virtualization & containers:** Docker, Kubernetes, QEMU, lightweight VMs.
  * Cross-platform development across multiple hardware architectures.
  * Blockchain/Web3: decentralized identity, digital signatures, ledger-based ownership.

**What we offer**

  * Competitive salary based on skills and experience.
  * 20 days of paid vacation and 3 sick leave days per year.
  * Corporate accountant.

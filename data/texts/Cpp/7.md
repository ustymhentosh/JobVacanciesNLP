We are looking for a Senior Embedded C++ Software Developer for our German
Client — a leading full-service provider of solutions for the public
transportation industry. The company supplies individual components and
integrated system solutions from one source. You’ll become part of the team
which develops a back-end API for the ticket management system for the public
transport sector.

Also, there will be work related to the front-end part. The Client’s
applications in the back end must be made available in the front-end devices.
This applies to operating data, master data, device parameters, and billing
data. The data stored in applications cannot be used by the front-end devices
in this form. Device data must therefore be prepared before data transfer.

  * Build UIs using Qt for embedded devices
  * Apply robust communication security and cryptography practices

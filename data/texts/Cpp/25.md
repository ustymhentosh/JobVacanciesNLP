### ABOUT PROJECT

This company is a provider of semiconductor technology solutions specializing
in reusable digital IP cores for ASIC and FPGA designs. Its portfolio includes
processor architectures (such as RISC-V), high-performance data compression
engines, standards-based industrial and networking interfaces (including CAN,
TSN, Ethernet, MIPI, PCI/AMBA), peripheral modules, and comprehensive SoC
security components — from cryptographic primitives to secure boot
implementations.

Operating since the early 1990s with offices across North America and Europe,
the company adheres to ISO 9001:2015 quality standards and offers flexible
licensing models with direct developer support. Its customers in automotive,
industrial, defense, and IoT sectors rely on these IP solutions to accelerate
development cycles, meet functional safety requirements (e.g., ISO 26262), and
enable high-throughput data processing — with its technologies integrated into
billions of devices worldwide.

**Responsibilities:**  
• Develop, optimize, and maintain software applications for single-board
computers (SBCs) such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and similar
platforms.  
• Integrate software components with various hardware interfaces (sensors,
actuators, communication modules) on SBCs.  
• Optimize software performance for resource-constrained environments (CPU,
memory, power) on SBCs.  
• Debug and troubleshoot software and hardware integration issues on SBC
platforms.

• Collaborate with hardware engineers to define hardware requirements and
ensure seamless software integration.  
• Contribute to the development and maintenance of build systems and
deployment pipelines for SBC software.  
• Adapt and/or rewrite existing software to run efficiently and reliably on
target SBC platforms.  
• Participate in code reviews and contribute to improving software quality.

  
**Required Qualifications:**  
• 3+ years of experience in software development, with a focus on embedded
systems or hardware interfacing.  
• Strong programming skills in C, or C++.  
• Strong understanding of Linux operating system and command-line tools.  
• Experience with single-board computers (SBCs) such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA
Jetson Nano, or similar.  
• Experience with hardware interfacing and communication protocols (UART, SPI,
I2C, etc.).  
• Proficiency in software debugging and troubleshooting techniques.  
• Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git).

  
**Will be a plus:**  
• Experience with STM32  
• Python knowledge

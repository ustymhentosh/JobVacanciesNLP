We are seeking an experienced C++ Developer to join the Gyrolab Electronics
team full-time at our R&D office in Kyiv. You will play a role in developing
cutting-edge embedded systems and desktop terminals, contributing to the
design, implementation, and optimization of software components.

**Responsibilities and Domains**

In this role, your primary focus will be on engineering robust, stable, and
high-performance C++ code using modern standards (C++20/C++23 and above). We
value strong analytical and problem-solving skills, enabling you to tackle
complex challenges both autonomously and collaboratively within our team.

**General:**

  * Designing, developing, and maintaining clean, efficient, and reliable C++ code for embedded Linux platforms and desktop Windows.
  * Collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams (hardware, software, QA) to define requirements, design solutions, and integrate components.
  * Debugging and resolving complex software issues, often involving interaction with hardware.
  * Participating in code reviews, providing and receiving constructive feedback.
  * Contributing to testing strategies and implementation to ensure software quality.

You may not work in  _all_ the areas listed below simultaneously but your
contributions will likely span several of these domains (you may also not have
experience with that but we expect you to learn it in the process):

  * **Video Processing:** Developing and optimizing real-time video processing pipelines on embedded systems.
  * **Image Processing:** Implementing and optimizing algorithms for image enhancement, stabilization, or correction.
  * **Control Loops:** Designing and implementing real-time control loops for system components or interaction with external hardware.
  * **Telemetry & Monitoring: **Developing software for collecting, processing, and reporting system telemetry, diagnostics, and performance data.
  * **Qt GUI Application Development:** Build and enhance Qt-based operator application (Windows) for system interaction, ensuring clean UI, intuitive UX, and robust networking. Focus includes tools for configuration, control, performance measurement display, and diagnostics.

**Requirements:**

  * 3+ years of experience in C++ development on Linux platforms writing stable, performant, and maintainable code
  * Experience with version control systems (Git)
  * Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with the ability to work both independently and as part of a team.
  * Excellent communication and teamwork skills
  * Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field.
  * Intermediate level of English

**Will be a plus:**

  * Knowledge of Rust programming language is a plus (while we don’t have a Rust codebase currently, familiarity with its principles is valued).
  * Experience with automated testing, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
  * Experience with video encoding/decoding standards (particularly HEVC) and associated libraries (e.g., FFmpeg).
  * Utilizing hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) via APIs like OpenGL (shaders) or CUDA for video tasks.
  * Experience with techniques like geometric transformations (homography, non-affine), lens distortion correction, or deshading.
  * Familiarity with image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV).
  * Experience with control protocols or systems relevant to robotics, cameras, or gimbals (e.g., MAVLink, SimpleBGC/AlexMos, Sony VISCA).

**We offer:**

  * Work from R&D office in Kyiv
  * The opportunity to contribute to the development of defense and high-tech innovations in Ukraine
  * Job type: full-time, schedule 5/2 (10–19 or 9–18)
  * Official employment (gig-contract)
  * 24 days of paid annual leave 
  * Military service deferment for eligible employees with valid military registration documents
  * All necessary computer equipment and work-related tools
  * Office equipped with a generator and a stable internet connection

**Interview process:**

  1. Recruiting interview — 45 min
  2. Technical interview — 1.5 hours
  3. Final interview — 30 min

Please send your CV and we will come back to you within 5 working days in case
your skills are suitable.

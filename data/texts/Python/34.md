We are working on a real-time data processing solution using smart meter
technologies. Our system integrates with **Gurux** (GXDLMS /
GXDeviceFramework) and requires a robust, high-performance parser capable of
handling live data streams efficiently and reliably.

**What We Are Looking For:**  
We need an experienced backend developer who can:

✅ Build or enhance a **real-time data parser** for Gurux-based data  
✅ Work with **DLMS/COSEM protocols** and GXDLMS libraries  
✅ Ensure **high performance** , low latency, and scalable architecture  
✅ Be comfortable working in **C# or Python**  
✅ Troubleshoot communication and decoding issues with smart meters  
✅ Collaborate on architecture decisions and documentation

**Nice-to-Have Skills:**

  * Experience with **energy/utility metering devices**
  * Knowledge of **OBIS codes** and smart meter telemetry
  * Real-time data streaming technologies (MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, etc.)
  * Familiarity with embedded communication protocols (RS485, M-Bus, etc.)

**Deliverables:**

  * Functional real-time parser integrated with Gurux framework
  * Unit tests and performance benchmarks
  * Technical documentation for maintenance and scaling

**Engagement Details:**

  * Remote collaboration
  * Short-term with potential extension
  * Start: Immediately
  * Competitive compensation depending on experience

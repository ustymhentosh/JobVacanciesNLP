layer — integrating APIs, managing trading events, and ensuring system
stability under real market conditions.  
This role suits an experienced Python developer passionate about real-time
systems, automation, and financial technologies.

### **Required Skills & Experience**

  * 4+ years of backend development, primarily with Python
  * Experience with trading APIs, REST/WebSocket integrations, and real-time data
  * Solid understanding of concurrency, idempotency, and event-driven systems
  * Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS)
  * Good knowledge of OAuth2, KMS, and security best practices
  * Upper-intermediate or higher English level

### **Nice to Have**

  * Background in futures trading or brokerage integrations
  * Knowledge of Node.js or Go
  * Experience with Prometheus, Grafana, or OpenTelemetry
  * Familiarity with risk systems, compliance automation, or IaC tools

### **Responsibilities**

  * Build and optimize the backend execution API and WebSocket communication layer
  * Manage order lifecycle, reconciliation, and error recovery logic
  * Integrate brokerage APIs for orders, accounts, and market data
  * Implement OAuth2 authentication, secret rotation, and risk controls
  * Add observability tools — metrics, tracing, and logging
  * Ensure safe deployments and environment isolation (paper/live trading)

### **Tech Stack**

Backend: Python (FastAPI or similar), optional Node.js / Go  
Infra: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines  
Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka / RabbitMQ / SQS  
Security: OAuth2, KMS/HSM, RBAC  
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

### **Project Description**

We’re developing a**** next-generation trading infrastructure — a secure
execution gateway that connects our trading web app with brokerage APIs. The
system manages order execution, real-time data streaming, account
synchronization, and risk control — ensuring reliability, scalability, and
speed in live trading environments.

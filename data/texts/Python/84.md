**Swarmer** is a Vendor-Agnostic Autonomy for Coordinated Robots. We develop
AI-managed collaborative autonomy to make teams of connected drones and
autonomous systems smart, efficient, and self-improving over time.

Currently, we are looking for an **Ardupilot****Engineer.**

📌 **ROLE OVERVIEW:**

We are seeking a skilled and motivated **Ardupilot Engineer** to design,
implement, and optimize autonomous flight control solutions for UAVs and
robotic platforms. The ideal candidate will have strong experience working
with **Ardupilot or PX4** , a deep understanding of **MAVLink communication,
system configuration, flight tuning, and debugging** , and a passion for
pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems. You’ll collaborate with AI,
perception, and mission-planning teams to build reliable, adaptive, and
intelligent multi-robot systems.

  
**📌 WHAT YOU’LL DO:**

  * Develop, configure, and test Ardupilot-based flight control systems for various UAV platforms.
  * Debug and optimize flight behaviors, parameters, and mission execution in both SITL (Software-in-the-Loop) and real flight environments
  * Work closely with hardware engineers to support sensor integration (GPS, cameras, LiDAR, etc.) and ensure robust flight performance.
  * Contribute to documentation, simulation environments, and internal development standards.

📌 **WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:**

  * **3+ years** of hands-on experience with **Ardupilot** , **PX4** , or similar open-source autopilot stacks.
  * Strong knowledge of **MAVLink** , **mission planning** , and UAV communication protocols.
  * Practical experience with **UAV tuning** , flight testing, and log analysis (Mission Planner, MAVProxy, etc.).
  * Experience with **EKF configuration, tuning, and debugging** to ensure accurate navigation and state estimation.
  * Understanding of autonomous navigation/LMT/VizNav, control theory, or multi-agent coordination 
  * Ability to work independently in a fast-paced R&D environment.
  * Experience working with **Python** or any similar language for custom module development. — a strong plus.
  * Familiarity with **Linux** environments and onboard companion computer setups (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or similar). — a strong plus.
  * Knowledge of **Betaflight/INAV** or other flight controller firmware — a strong plus.

📌 **WE OFFER:**

  * Direct impact in a high-stakes industry where your work enables autonomous systems used on the ground.
  * Professional growth through exposure to advanced UAV autonomy technologies and international DevOps best practices.
  * Competitive salary and comprehensive benefits package (insurance, paid sick leave, 20 paid days off per year).
  * Benefits of the defense sector (reservation and related advantages).
  * Flexible remote work options (possibility to commute to the office if needed is essential).

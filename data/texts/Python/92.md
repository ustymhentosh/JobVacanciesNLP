### About Us

We build B2B legal technology that helps law firms and fund managers work
faster and with higher quality. Our main product simplifies legal workflows
for private investment funds, helping lawyers speed up drafting, negotiation,

We use a modern, single-tenant SaaS setup on AWS across several regions. Our
stack includes Python/Django 4.2, React 18/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, S3, ECS, and Lambda. We work in Agile Scrum teams
and follow strong CI/CD, Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Terragrunt), and
security practices (SOPS, KMS).

We are looking for an outstanding integrations developer for Recorded Future’s
integrations team. You will be joining a group of talented developers that
share a common interest in making Recorded Future’s data available in various
other systems and platforms. The core focus for this role is the integrations
between the Recorded Future platform and the multiple tools used by
organizations to protect their IT infrastructure. Some examples of such tools
are SIEM systems (System Information and Event Management, ex Splunk, and
QRadar), SOAR systems (System Orchestration and Automated Response, ex.,
Splunk SOAR, Demisto), Incident Response systems (e.g., ServiceNow), or TIPs
(Threat Intelligence Platform, ex MISP). We’re the bridge between our data and
our client’s systems.

We’re a full-cycle/full-stack development team — meaning that you will be part
of the complete life cycle of integration from concept and design to
implementation, maintenance, and eventually end-of-life.

You also love new stuff! At Recorded Future, you will get a chance to play
with new technology, evaluate it, and see what’s most appropriate for solving
real-world problems. You have at least a couple of years of coding experience.
You are a self-starter and have excellent communication skills.

**Why join us**  
If you’re looking for a place to grow, make an impact, and work with people
who care, we’d love to meet you! :)

**About the role**  
This role offers the chance to lead backend development and shape a next-
generation AI-powered platform. You’ll build scalable Python systems,
contribute across the stack, and collaborate directly with product and
leadership to turn complex business needs into impactful technical solutions.
Working in a fast-paced, experiment-driven environment, you’ll prototype,
iterate, and take ownership of features that deliver real user value. With a
culture that values speed, independence, and collaboration, this role lets you
make significant technical and product impact while growing as a senior
engineer.

**What you will do**  
● **Lead backend development:** design, implement, and maintain scalable
backend systems in Python;  
● **Contribute across the stack:** while backend is the main focus, be open to
occasional frontend contributions (Vue.js, React, etc.) when needed;  
● **Collaborate with product & CEO:** work closely with stakeholders to
understand business needs and turn them into technical solutions;  
● **Prototype quickly & iterate:** deliver functional, scrappy prototypes for
fast learning and adjust based on feedback;  
● **Work with production feedback:** build features that can be tested with
real users, monitor performance, and iterate rapidly;  
● **Take ownership:** make sound engineering decisions independently, ensuring
alignment with product goals;  
● **Support a culture of speed and experimentation:** balance technical
quality with business value, optimizing for learning and time-to-market.

**Must haves**  
● **Proven experience of 4+ years as a Senior Python back-end engineer** ;  
● A strong product-focused mindset and genuine interest in solving user and
business problems, not just delivering code;  
● A proactive nature, with a habit of asking questions and seeking to
understand the bigger picture;  
● Ability to think quickly, make strong engineering decisions, and adapt to
changing requirements;  
● Independence, ownership, and comfort working with minimal supervision;  
● Must be based in Europe time zones (GMT+0 to GMT+5);  
● Upper-Intermediate English level.

**Nice to haves**  
● Experience with Python web frameworks like Django or FastAPI;  
● Experience in an early-stage startup environment;  
● Experience with building with LLMs or building agentic AI systems;  
● Front-end experience with frameworks like Vue.js or React;  
● Leadership experience.

contributions with competitive USD-based compensation and budgets for

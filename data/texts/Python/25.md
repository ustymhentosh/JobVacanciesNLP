**About the company:**  
  
CostCare AI is a Ukrainian B2B SaaS startup building AI Sales Agents for the
Social Commerce market. Our agents act as virtual employees — answering
customer inquiries, syncing with CRMs, booking consultations, and even
generating payment links — all within social media platforms.

early users to improve the product and find the right market focus. The
roadmap ahead is exciting and we’re scaling fast.

**Your role:**

We’re looking for a strong**Python Engineer** who enjoys building fast,
iterating quickly, and cares about clean, reliable code. You’ll join at a
stage where your voice matters — working on architecture, improving
performance, and shaping how our AI agents function and scale.

### **What you’ll be working on:**

  * Build backend features for voice & chat LLM agents
  * Build multi-agent flows: prompting, tool calling, handoffs
  * Improve existing agentic systems : reliability, latency, and overall quality
  * Help define and build our eval system (quality/latency/accuracy) 
  * Work on integrations such as: telegram, whatsapp, CRMs(hubspot, etc)
  * Collaborate directly with CTO

**Tech Stack:**

  * **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, asyncio, LiveKit Agents
  * **AI/LLM:** , OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Cartesia
  * **Telephony:** Twilio, LiveKit
  * **Database:** MongoDB, Qdrant, S3, Redis
  * **Infra:** Docker, K8S, AWS, DigitalOcean

The product is still in an early stage, so you’ll have the opportunity to
influence the tech stack and help shape the architecture as we grow.

### **We’re looking for someone who:**

  * Has **deep Python experience** and strong backend engineering fundamentals.
  * Understands **system design** , the pros and cons of different approaches, and can deliver from idea to production.
  * Communicates clearly and takes ownership.
  * Has a **product mindset** — solves real problems, not just code tickets.
  * Can work independently and isn’t afraid to ask questions, make decisions, or challenge ideas.

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience working with **AI agents / LLMs**
  * Prompt engineering skills
  * Familiarity with **LangGraph** or vector databases

### **Our Values:**

  * Mutual Respect: We’re building a healthy, collaborative environment where people feel safe, supported, and inspired to grow together.
  * Customer Obsession: We believe our unfair advantage is truly caring about our customers and solving their real problems.
  * Trust & Responsibility: We trust each other to take ownership, and in return, we expect them to be responsible and keep growing.
  * Honesty: Mistakes happen — what matters is having the courage to own them, learn from them, and solve things together.
  * Ambition: We’re aiming high — to build a billion-dollar company and lead the way in AI agent technology.

### **Why join us?**

  * You’ll join early, shape core systems, and make a real impact.
  * Zero bureaucracy, flexible hours, fully remote.
  * Paid time off (20 vacation + 10 sick days).

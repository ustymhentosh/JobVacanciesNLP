### **Your Project**

We are looking for a skilled CNF Deployment Engineer with strong experience in
deploying Cloud-Native Functions (CNFs) on Kubernetes and OpenShift Container
Platform (OCP) clusters. The ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of
containerized environments, Linux operating systems, and network functions
virtualization (NFV).  
You will be responsible for managing, deploying, and troubleshooting CNF
workloads on cloud infrastructure, ensuring optimal performance, scalability,
and security.

### **Your Role**

  * Deploy and manage Cloud-Native Functions (CNF) on Kubernetes and OpenShift (OCP) clusters.
  * Ensure high availability and scalability of CNF applications using Kubernetes features such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), Cluster Autoscaler, and Load Balancers.
  * Optimize CNF deployments for performance and resource usage, including defining resource requests/limits and configuring pod autoscaling strategies.
  * Monitor and maintain the health and performance of CNF deployments using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, or similar.
  * Troubleshoot and resolve issues with CNF deployments in production and pre-production environments, identifying and addressing problems related to networking, storage, load balancing, and security.
  * Collaborate with DevOps, Infrastructure, and Security teams to ensure smooth deployment and operation of CNF workloads.
  * Implement best practices for security, resource management, and configuration of CNF deployments.
  * Ensure that CNF applications meet security requirements, including handling secrets, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and vulnerability scanning.
  * Act as a self-motivated problem solver with the ability to work independently and proactively address challenges.
  * Maintain documentation and share knowledge related to CNF deployment processes, troubleshooting guides, and best practices.
  * Handle SSL certificate management, including generation, renewal, and troubleshooting for secure communication in CNF deployments.
  * Configure and manage OpenShift routes, Kubernetes Ingress controllers, and related networking components for traffic routing to CNF applications

### **Your Profile**

  * 3+ years of hands-on experience working with Kubernetes and OpenShift (OCP) clusters.
  * Proficiency in Linux Operating Systems (Red Hat, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.).
  * Experience with containerization technologies such as Docker.
  * Strong knowledge of network functions virtualization (NFV) and cloud-native design patterns.
  * Experience with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) for automating deployments.
  * Proficient in Helm and other Kubernetes deployment management tools.
  * Experience in package management â€” image and chart repositories like Nexus, Harbor, etc.
  * Experience in managing SSL certificates, OpenShift Routes, and Ingress controllers.
  * Familiarity with Kubernetes networking (CNI), service meshes, and related technologies (e.g., Istio, Calico).
  * Hands-on experience with Prometheus, Grafana, or other monitoring tools.
  * Strong understanding of Kubernetes Operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), and Kubernetes security features (e.g., RBAC, secrets management).
  * Familiarity with networking concepts (VLANs, TCP/IP, DNS, Load Balancing, etc.).
  * Experience with Shell scripting, Python, or other scripting languages.
  * Excellent troubleshooting skills, with the ability to resolve complex issues in live production environments.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

  * Experience with Telco CNF deployments in a production environment.
  * Knowledge of OpenShift Operators and advanced features of OCP.
  * Certifications such as Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration, or equivalent.

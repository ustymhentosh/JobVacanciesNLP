it (e.g. via Git, CI/CD)  
● Good communication skills and ability to work cross-functionally (dev,
support, ops)

**Nice to have:**  
● Past experience or proficiency in C# (especially where it interfaces with
infrastructure or tools)  
● Experience with container orchestration (e.g. EKS, ECS, Kubernetes) or
integrating monitoring into container environments  
● Experience with additional IaC tooling (e.g. Terraform), CM tools (Ansible),
or multi-cloud exposure  
● Experience with advanced observability patterns: anomaly detection,
distributed tracing, logging pipelines  
● AWS certifications (e.g. Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer) or prior
formal training in cloud principles

**Key Responsibilities:**

● Help with migration of the project to AWS cloud following best practices and
Well-Architected framework;  
● Design proper IaC solution which easy to maintain and develop;

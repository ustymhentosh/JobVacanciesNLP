We are seeking a skilled and proactive DevOps Engineer to join our technology
team. The ideal candidate will take ownership of the infrastructure, build and
deploy pipelines, and operational reliability of our platforms. A key aspect
of this role will be collaborating closely with our external hosting provider,
who delivers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), to ensure secure, scalable,
and resilient environments.

### Key Responsibilities:

  * Infrastructure Management:  
Work with our hosting partner to design, implement, and maintain cloud-based
infrastructure. Ensure optimal performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency
across environments.

  * Test Automation & CI/CD:  
Build and manage continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Automate
build, test, and release processes to enable rapid and reliable software
delivery.

  * Monitoring & Reliability:  
Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and logging solutions to ensure high
system availability. Perform root-cause analysis of production issues and
drive improvements.

  * Security & Compliance:  
Collaborate with the IaaS provider to apply security best practices, including
access control, encryption, patch management, and compliance monitoring.

  * Collaboration with Hosting Partner:  
Act as the technical liaison between internal development teams and the IaaS
hosting company. Define service-level expectations, manage infrastructure
changes, and coordinate incident response and performance optimization.

  * Infrastructure as Code (IaC):  
Develop and maintain infrastructure through code using tools such as
Terraform, Ansible, or similar. Ensure version-controlled, repeatable, and
auditable configurations.

  * System Optimization:  
Continuously evaluate and enhance system performance, scaling, and cost
efficiency

### Requirements

  * Proven experience as a DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, or similar role.
  * Hands-on experience with CI/CD tools (e.g., TeamCity, Octopus, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or similar).
  * Experience working with Windows-based environments, Cloud/Private-Cloud and containerization (Azure, VM, Docker, Kubernetes).
  * Familiarity with monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog).
  * Strong understanding of networking, security, and cloud fundamentals.
  * Experience collaborating with external vendors or hosting providers (IaaS or managed services).
  * Excellent communication and problem-solving skills.

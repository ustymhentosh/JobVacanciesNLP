**About us:**  
At MezePay, we’re revolutionizing how restaurants in Greece operate. From
seamless QR-based menus and ordering systems to modern, cloud-first POS
solutions, we empower hospitality businesses with tools built for the digital
era. We’re a fast-growing startup on a mission to bring simplicity, speed, and
efficiency to the traditional restaurant experience — one taverna at a time.

**About the role:**  
We’re looking for a **DevOps Engineer** to join our founding engineering team
and shape the infrastructure that powers MezePay’s platform. You’ll be
responsible for building, automating, and scaling reliable cloud environments
to ensure our systems stay fast, secure, and always available — from Athens to
Mykonos and beyond.

**Main responsibilities:**  
You will be the backbone of MezePay’s reliability and scalability:

  * Build and manage cloud infrastructure (we use GCP, but AWS/Azure experience is also welcome).
  * Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines for backend, frontend, and mobile deployments.
  * Manage and monitor Dockerized services using Kubernetes, Terraform, and Helm.
  * Set up robust logging, monitoring, and alerting systems (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, or Cloud Logging).
  * Automate operational tasks to improve delivery velocity and system resilience.
  * Ensure security best practices — SSL certificates, firewall rules, and secrets management.
  * Collaborate closely with backend and frontend engineers to optimize delivery pipelines and troubleshoot infrastructure issues.

**Your experience:**  
We would expect you to have:

  * 3+ years of experience managing infrastructure and deployments in cloud environments.
  * Hands-on experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration in production.
  * Proficiency with CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, or CircleCI).
  * Familiarity with Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or Ansible.
  * Knowledge of networking, security, and scaling best practices.
  * Experience supporting high-availability systems and real-time applications.

**Nice to have:**

  * Hands-on experience with GCP (especially Cloud Run, GKE, and Cloud SQL).
  * Helm chart authoring and management.
  * Database operations (PostgreSQL backups, scaling, replication).
  * Experience with self-hosted logging stacks (Loki, ELK).
  * Scripting skills in Bash or Python.
  * Background in POS or restaurant tech.

**What’s in it for you?**

  * Be the founding DevOps hire and shape our infrastructure from the ground up.
  * Work on tech that directly impacts restaurants across Greece.
  * Opportunity to grow into SRE, Platform Engineering, or DevSecOps leadership roles as we scale.
  * Small, driven, and collaborative team that moves fast and celebrates wins together.
  * Work directly with the customer, in a culture of ownership and impact.
  * 20 fully paid vacation days.
  * 15 fully paid sick leaves.
  * Paid public holidays.
  * Compensation for health insurance and sports club membership (after trial period).
  * Hybrid and remote work flexibility.

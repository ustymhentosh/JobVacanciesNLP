**About Us**  
Jiris Health is scaling fast and needs a solid DevOps foundation to support
our growth. We’re looking for someone to optimize our infrastructure and CI/CD
pipelines in a lean, efficient way.

**The Role**  
We’re seeking a **part-time DevOps Engineer** — ideally someone with a full-
time role looking for a meaningful side project. You’ll help us ensure uptime,
security, and scalability as we move toward launch.

**Responsibilities**

  * Manage and optimize CI/CD pipelines.
  * Implement best practices for infrastructure and deployments.
  * Support security, compliance, and monitoring needs.
  * Help scale infrastructure as user base grows.

**Requirements**

  * Strong background in cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP).
  * Hands-on experience with CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
  * Familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes, and IaC.
  * Previous startup/healthcare experience a plus.

**Why Join Us**

  * Flexible part-time role with high impact.
  * Be part of a mission-driven product while maintaining your main role.
  * Opportunity to shape infrastructure strategy from the ground up.

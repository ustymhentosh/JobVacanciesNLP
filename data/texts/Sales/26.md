**AVELaunch** is a platform for scaling expertise and intellectual products.  
We work with entrepreneurs, coaches, consultants, and thought leaders — people
with deep experience who aim not only to grow their business but also to shape
their industries through structured expertise.

Our **AVELaunch Books** division specializes in creating **non-fiction books
from A to Z**.  
We help experts transform their knowledge and experience into meaningful,
structured books — powerful tools for influence, trust, and growth.  
In each project, we dive deeply into the author’s story, capture their unique
voice, and craft a product that builds authority in their professional
community.

We don’t just write books — we **build long-term intellectual brands** that
help our clients enter new markets, expand their audiences, and strengthen
their expert positioning.  
Currently, our main focus is **developing the US market** , where personal
branding and thought leadership culture are especially strong.

### **About the Role**

As a **Sales Manager (US Market)** at AVELaunch Books, you’ll be the first
point of contact for our future clients — mainly **experts, entrepreneurs, and
coaches from the US**.  
Your mission is to guide them from first interest to a clear “yes” — showing
how a book can become a strategic tool for business growth, visibility, and
reputation.

This is a **full-cycle sales role** : from initial communication to deal
closure and post-sale relationship management.

**Key Responsibilities:**

— Manage the **full sales cycle** for US-based clients: first contact, needs
discovery, presentation, objection handling, closing the deal, and follow-up.

— Conduct **discovery calls** with potential authors — entrepreneurs,
consultants, and coaches.

— Build trust-based relationships: ask thoughtful questions, understand goals,
and help clients see the value behind the product.

— Keep all processes structured in **CRM** , track funnel performance, and
identify improvement areas.

— Collaborate closely with the **marketing team** to provide feedback on lead
quality and audience signals.

— Communicate in a way that aligns with **American business culture** —
structured, transparent, and value-driven.

**We’re Looking for Someone Who:**

— Has experience **working with US-based clients** or a solid understanding of
American business communication.

— Is comfortable with proactive outreach: writing messages, making calls,
recording voice/video intros.

— Can structure conversations, ask deep questions, and guide clients toward
decisions.

— Is communicative, proactive, resilient, and consistent in daily follow-ups.

— Speaks **English at B2+ level (required)** for calls and written
communication.

— Uses tools like **Google Sheets, Zoom/Meet, CRM systems, messengers, and AI
tools.**

**Nice to Have:**

— Experience in **B2B, EdTech, consulting, marketing, or content production.**

— Knowledge of **SPIN, BANT, or Feel—Felt—Found** sales techniques.

— Background in **value-based sales** — focusing on solving real client needs,
not pushing a product.

— Experience selling creative or expert-driven services to US clients.

**What We Offer:**

— Format: **fully remote** , full-time.

— Schedule: **Mon—Fri, flexible hours** , with partial overlap for US time
zones.

— Trial period: 3 months.

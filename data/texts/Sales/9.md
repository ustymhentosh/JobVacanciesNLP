businesses optimize their spending on SaaS, cloud services, and corporate

  * Track record of building or scaling Customer Success/Support in fast-growing, high-volume environments (fintech, SaaS, or similar)
  * You know how to design processes, automate the boring stuff, and pick the right tools (support platforms, CRM, self-service, chat, etc.)
  * Obsessed with metrics — NPS, retention, churn, response times — and how to move them in the right direction
  * Strong leadership skills: you’ve recruited, grown, and inspired teams in a startup or scale-up setting
  * A clear communicator with a true customer-first mindset
  * English B2+/C1 is a must

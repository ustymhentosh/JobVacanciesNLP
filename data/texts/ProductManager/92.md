Spendbase is an all-in-one spend optimization platform that helps companies
manage cloud costs, SaaS subscriptions, virtual cards, and financial
operations in one place. Our cloud direction is scaling fast — we’re bringing
in hundreds of new customers every month, and now we’re looking for an
operational leader who can turn that growth into a world-class user
experience.

We’re looking for a **Cloud Operations Manager** who will own and optimize the
end-to-end user journey — from signup to activation and successful onboarding.
You’ll work closely with our operational, product, and marketing teams to
build automation, streamline workflows, and accelerate the time it takes for
users to  _go_ live.

Your mission is to turn a 30-day onboarding process into a 3-day one through
automation, operational precision, and data-driven improvements.

  * Conversion optimization: Analyze conversion metrics across each funnel stage and implement changes to maximize activation and retention rates.
  * Cross-team collaboration: Work with marketing to align lead generation with capacity, and with operations to deliver seamless onboarding experiences.
  * Monitor performance: Build dashboards and KPIs for onboarding time, conversion rate, activation percentage, and automation coverage.
  * Continuous improvement: Lead experiments, run A/B tests, and iterate on user flows and communications.

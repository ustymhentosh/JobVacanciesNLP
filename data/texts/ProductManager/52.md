MacPaw is a software company that develops and distributes software for macOS
and iOS. Today, we have 20 million active users across all our products, and
every 5th Mac on Earth has our product installed.

At MacPaw, we believe humans and technology can reach their greatest potential
together.

We gather open-minded people who support each other and aspire to change the
world around us, making millions of people’s lives easier with technology.

Our flagship products include [CleanMyMac](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac),
[Setapp](https://setapp.com/), [ClearVPN](https://macpaw.com/clearvpn),
[Moonlock](https://macpaw.com/moonlock), and more. Now, we’re stepping into an
important new stage: launching a product ecosystem with a new AI Mac Assistant
— [Eney.](https://macpaw.com/eney)

We create software that makes Mac life simpler and more enjoyable. Our
flagship product, **CleanMyMac,** is trusted by millions of users worldwide to
keep their Macs clean, optimized, and secure.

We are now looking for an experienced **Head of Product** to lead the next
chapter of CleanMyMac’s evolution. The previous Head of Product has
transitioned into the role of Chief Product Officer, and we’re seeking a
strong leader to take the helm and guide the product toward a smarter, more
user-centric, AI-powered future.

You will shape the vision, strategy, and execution of MacPaw’s most important
product, focusing on improving user experience, driving innovation, and
ensuring CleanMyMac continues to deliver outstanding value to users worldwide.
You’ll also lead change management initiatives — shifting the team toward a
model where Product Managers own user metrics (satisfaction, retention,
perceived value) while Growth Managers drive revenue outcomes.

You’ll work closely with the Executive Team, align the product with MacPaw’s
broader ecosystem strategy, and play a key role in defining the future of
CleanMyMac in the era of AI.

If this sounds interesting to you and you have the necessary experience to
succeed in this role — send us your CV. We will be glad to get to know you!

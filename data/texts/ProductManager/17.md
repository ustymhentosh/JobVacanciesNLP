marketing, and tech, and help us grow fast.

### **What You’ll Do**

  * **Product Ownership** — understand how the product works end-to-end, ensure stability, identify growth opportunities, and manage continuous improvement.
  * **Product Growth** — monitor the market and competitors, test hypotheses, launch product experiments, and evaluate their impact.
  * **API Integrations** — select, analyze, and manage APIs; assess technical quality, latency, and cost to ensure smooth performance.
  * **Funnel Analytics & A/B Testing** — analyze conversion flows, build hypotheses, run A/B tests, find bottlenecks, and optimize results.
  * **Incident Management** — respond fast to unexpected events, assess risks, communicate with stakeholders, and lead issue resolution.
  * **User Support Insights** — assist the support team with complex cases using data analysis and process insights.
  * **Product & Marketing Analytics** — manage tracking structures, create dashboards, interpret data, and drive data-informed actions.
  * **Business Analytics & Prioritization** — understand key metrics, propose experiments that improve them, and prioritize initiatives by business impact.

### **Core Skills & Experience**

  * Hands-on work with no-code/low-code tools (Cursor or similar).
  * Ability to test, choose, and integrate APIs with an eye for quality, latency, and cost.

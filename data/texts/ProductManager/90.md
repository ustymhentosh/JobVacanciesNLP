**CleanMyMac** helps millions of users around the world keep their Macs clean,
fast, and organized. As a **Growth Manager** , you will join the CleanMyMac
team and drive measurable impact across the full customer journey — from
acquisition and activation to monetization and retention.

In this role, you’ll turn the company’s growth strategy into hands-on
experiments and data-driven initiatives. You’ll own the growth backlog,
identify opportunities, and lead cross-functional collaboration to deliver
real business results.

You’ll work within the MacPaw Growth operating model, reporting to the Head of
Growth, and partnering closely with Product, Marketing, and Analytics teams.

If you love exploring “what ifs,” thrive on experimentation, and want to make
a tangible difference in how millions of people experience CleanMyMac — we’d
love to meet you.

### In this role, you will:

  * Own the product growth backlog — identify opportunities from data and research, formulate hypotheses, estimate impact, and prioritize initiatives in alignment with the Head of Growth, Product Manager, and Product Marketing Manager.
  * Design and execute experiments: define variants, success metrics, and guardrails; coordinate with Engineering and Design; ensure proper instrumentation and deliver clear readouts with actionable next steps.
  * Drive full-funnel growth by improving acquisition quality, onboarding flows, pricing and packaging tests, upsell/cross-sell, and churn reduction initiatives.
  * Collaborate with Marketing to implement and scale successful growth experiments while maintaining brand and compliance standards.
  * Propose and test monetization initiatives — pricing, packaging, bundles, referral, and win-back campaigns — and quantify their impact on ARPU and revenue.
  * Design lifecycle and retention programs, including triggered journeys, churn intercepts, and reactivation flows informed by segmentation and predictive insights.
  * Partner with Analytics to ensure accurate tracking, event schemas, cohorts, and funnel visibility; support experiment design and evaluation.
  * Lead weekly growth rituals (standups, reviews, demos) and ensure cross-functional alignment and timely escalation of blockers.
  * Contribute to continuous improvement of the Growth operating model, suggesting enhancements to processes, scoring, and tools. Promote a culture of experimentation and learning.

### Skills you’ll need to bring:

  * 3–6 years of experience in growth, product, or marketing analytics roles.
  * Proven track record of designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests and lifecycle experiments.
  * Proficiency with product analytics, funnels, cohorts, and basic statistical concepts.
  * Ability to write clear experiment specifications and communicate insights effectively.
  * Strong collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills with a bias toward action and measurable results.

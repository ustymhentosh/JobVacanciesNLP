  * **Manage and prioritize backlog:** Take full control of tasks, set priorities, and maintain clarity and progress for development, design, and QA teams.
  * **Develop key modules:** Drive the evolution of UI/UX, game modules, bonus systems, and payments — from concept to production.
  * **Ensure release quality:** Oversee releases, acceptance testing, and post-release performance metrics.
  * **Conduct market research:** Track key market trends, user funnels, bonus systems, and retention tools to identify new opportunities for growth.
  * **Optimize user journeys:** Analyze and improve the player experience — from registration and deposit to engagement and retention — through A/B testing and UX hypotheses.
  * **Collaborate cross-functionally:** Work closely with development, QA, design, marketing, retention, and analytics teams.
  * **Monitor product metrics:** Analyze KPIs (FTD, ARPU, LTV, Retention, Churn, Conversion) and provide actionable insights and recommendations.
  * **Run experiments and hypotheses:** Launch and validate experiments aimed at improving UX, conversion, and retention.

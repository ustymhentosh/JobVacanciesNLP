We make software that helps people love their devices as much as we do. From
cleaning and optimization to privacy and performance — our products are
designed to keep digital life simple, safe, and smart.

Now, we’re growing **[CleanMyPhone](https://macpaw.com/cleanmyphone)** , a new
product in the MacPaw portfolio built to help users reclaim space and keep
their phones clutter-free. And we’re looking for a **Growth Manager** to lead
it.

You’ll own the growth strategy for a fast-scaling product. Your goal will be
to turn insights into experiments — driving measurable improvements in
acquisition, activation, monetization, and retention.

You’ll work within MacPaw’s Growth operating model, partnering closely with
Product, Marketing, Design, and Engineering teams to identify opportunities,
test hypotheses, and scale what works.

If you love experimenting with new ways to grow user value and revenue — and
want to shape the future of a new mobile product — this is the place to do it!

### In this role, you will:

  * Own the product growth backlog — identify opportunities from data and research, formulate hypotheses, estimate impact, and prioritize initiatives in alignment with the Head of Growth, Product Manager, and Product Marketing Manager.
  * Design and execute experiments: define variants, success metrics, and guardrails; coordinate with Engineering and Design; ensure proper instrumentation and deliver clear readouts with actionable next steps.
  * Drive full-funnel growth by improving acquisition quality, onboarding flows, pricing and packaging tests, upsell/cross-sell, and churn reduction initiatives.
  * Collaborate with Marketing to implement and scale successful growth experiments while maintaining brand and compliance standards.
  * Propose and test monetization initiatives — pricing, packaging, bundles, referral, and win-back campaigns — and quantify their impact on ARPU and revenue.
  * Design lifecycle and retention programs, including triggered journeys, churn intercepts, and reactivation flows informed by segmentation and predictive insights.
  * Partner with Analytics to ensure accurate tracking, event schemas, cohorts, and funnel visibility; support experiment design and evaluation.
  * Lead weekly growth rituals (standups, reviews, demos) and ensure cross-functional alignment and timely escalation of blockers.
  * Contribute to continuous improvement of the Growth operating model, suggesting enhancements to processes, scoring, and tools. Promote a culture of experimentation and learning.

### Skills you’ll need to bring:

  * 3–6 years of experience in Growth, Product, or Marketing Analytics roles.
  * Proven track record of designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests and lifecycle experiments.
  * Proficiency with product analytics, funnels, cohorts, and basic statistical concepts.
  * Ability to write clear experiment specifications and communicate insights effectively.
  * Strong collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills with a bias toward action and measurable results.

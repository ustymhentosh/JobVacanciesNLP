### **Our Mission and Vision**

At Solidgate, our mission is clear: to empower outstanding entrepreneurs to
build exceptional internet companies. We exist to fuel the builders — the ones
shaping the digital economy — with the financial infrastructure they deserve.
To achieve that, we’re on a bold path: to become the #1 payments orchestration
platform in the world.

### **What you will own**

You’ll lead our effort to make the acquisition fully product-led and ready to
scale as a **Product Manager** on a **Launch Team**. The Launch team owns the
first steps of the merchant journey — from visiting our site to going live.
Think of it as the Top of the Funnel from the user’s perspective. Your goal:

  * Turn onboarding into a growth engine
  * Provide users with the most effortless and user-friendly experience when starting to work with Solidgate
  * Build flows that work without human involvement — from discovery to first transaction

You’ll shape and evolve these core components:

  * **Company Website & Acquisition** — communicate our value, convert interest into sign-ups
  * **Product Onboarding** — streamline account creation, configuration, and first-time setup
  * **Business Onboarding** — build smooth flows for KYB and compliance questionnaires
  * **Documentation** — craft clear, self-serve docs and guides to simplify merchant integration

### **Why this is sexy**

  * **Fast iteration** — most of your scope is Web-based, meaning quick releases and minimal dependencies
  * **Strong product culture** — you’ll work with product engineers who think about outcomes, not ticket counts
  * **Clear business impact** — this team directly drives merchant activation and top-of-funnel success
  * **Automation at scale** — we’re building systems that automate KYB and compliance, unlocking global expansion

### **Team Setup**

We build cross-functional teams. The Launch team consists of — Product Manager
(you :)), Tech Lead, 2 Backend Engineers, 2 Frontend Engineers, and 1 AQA
Engineer. Your future manager — [Artem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-
sadurskyy/), CPO.

### **What to expect — the B2B reality**

We move fast, but our world isn’t consumer-style growth hacking. Here’s what
that means:

  * We don’t rely on paid acquisition — our funnel is B2B, driven by product experience and reputation
  * No paid traffic, so A/B testing has limited statistical power — we experiment qualitatively and ship based on insight
  * You’ll collaborate closely with Compliance to evolve Business Onboarding — it’s a critical part of the merchant journey

### **Our ideal candidate?**

Has 3+ years in product management, delivering measurable results and scaling
products end-to-end. You lead teams effectively, drive impact through data and
analytics, and make decisions with analytics tools (Google Analytics, BI,
Hotjar, Clario, etc.).

one.

🌟 **Who are we, and what do we aspire to?**

Liven is a product company that builds a companion for self-discovery.

We believe that self-discovery is a lifelong journey and want to help people
navigate it every step of the way. That’s why Liven is building a system of
tools to help people compose themselves and grow into who they want to become.

People use Liven to track their mood, process emotions, and untangle thoughts
by chatting with an AI companion. They build new routines with a task planner,
explore how their brain and body react to trauma through personalized courses,
take well-being quizzes, and relax or refocus with soundscapes.

Our goal is to become the most trusted self-discovery companion globally.
Liven is here to define and lead the mental wellbeing category. We aim to earn
global trust by building an ecosystem of context-aware products for self-care
and improvement. Our brand is optimistic and whimsical, yet wise and
practical. We’re Liven! We bring joy back to life!

💪🏻**What will you enjoy most about being on the Liven team?**

Since 2023, we’ve been scaling non-stop. We’re expanding the product, the team
behind it, and our global reach. Liven has grown a lot since it was just a
team of four. But our priority remains the same: building a vibrant culture
where we share ideas, speedrun through challenges, and shape the business
together.

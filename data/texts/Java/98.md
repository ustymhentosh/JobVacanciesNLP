### About the Client

Our client company was founded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in 2018. We’ve
noticed that there is an enormous gap between hotels, on the one hand, and new
technologies on the other. Our goal is to improve and support hotels’ online
performance through the use of innovative solutions. The project combines
innovative technology, marketing expertise, and sales techniques in order to
offer a smart, high-performance tool. Our solution includes a set of multiple
features: personalized notifications, social proof messages, smart pop-ups,
interactive dashboard, and automated data-driven recommendations which improve
the user experience and create an instant impact on your conversion rate and
direct bookings. Our team is composed of marketing professionals, experts in
the online hotel industry, as well as software developers.

They have worked for companies such as Expedia,
[Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and Google. We guarantee that your hotel can
benefit from the same practices as these major platforms, even on a lower
budget. Contact us today to find out how you can maximize your potential.

### About Wix

Wix makes it possible for anyone to succeed online.

Since 2006, we’ve grown to around 5,300 employees in 22 countries, launched

At Wix, we push you to innovate, evolve in non-traditional ways, and
collaborate. We operate in small teams that work closely together at a high
level.

Although we’re already industry leaders in web creation and business, our work
is nowhere near done. Our goal is to become the main engine of the Internet so
we can create a more open web for all.

that everyone has the right to be successful, online. This same vision defines
us as a company: creating a work environment where everyone is welcome, and
anyone has the right to succeed._

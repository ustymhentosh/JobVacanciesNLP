**We are a telecommunications group led by lifecell.** We’re the top choice
for number portability—more customers switch to us from other operators than
to anyone else. During wartime, we prioritize keeping the country connected:
we invest in batteries and generators to ensure our base stations operate even
during power outages.

But lifecell is, above all, about people. More than 4,000 professionals across
Ukraine work together within our group of companies to advance telecom every
day. We value initiative, support fresh ideas, and share knowledge. Here,
you’ll find the stability of the lifecell and Datagroup alliance, the agility
of a modern business, and the backing of the international holding NJJ
Capital, which helps each of us grow.

We are a team of Lean Startup professionals for whom entrepreneurship and
startup culture are not just a job, but a way of life. We are not just “t _o
beat around the bush_ ” ones who aim to fulfil all of the customer’s requests
by adding more features to the project while “wasting the client’s budget”. We
prefer to leave that to the classic outsourcing companies!  
Our rich experience, enriched by hands-on work with startups and the
application of the Lean Startup approach, is the key to our outstanding
efficiency. Being on the market for 5 years, we have launched over 70
successful startups from scratch, working with clients around the world.  
  
**💡 We Create Startups for Clients from Different Countries**  
We specialise in helping entrepreneurs and startups from America/Europe launch
successful digital startup at early stages. Our goal is not just to launch,
but also to assist with the full understanding of the real market demand for
the product, thereby saving years of work and significant budgets of our
clients.  
  
**👥 A Team of Over 40 Experts**  
Our team consists of more than 40 specialists, each fully immersed in projects
and ready to offer the best solutions at every stage of product development.  
  
**🚀 Our Advantages:**

  * **Technological and Process Innovation.** We actively integrate the latest technologies into our work and constantly update and automate our processes to avoid bureaucracy and accelerate results.
  * **Individual Approach to Projects.** We are not just task executors; we strive to understand the unique needs of each project and realise them based on our expertise and innovative approaches.
  * **Strong Team Culture.** Our team is distinguished by a high level of mutual assistance and support, openness to feedback, and an absence of toxicity, which contributes to a favourable environment for the growth and development of both projects and the personal development of each employee.

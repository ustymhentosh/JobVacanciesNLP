Magnoli is an innovative system for dry cleaning operations in the United
States.

The system covers all functions â€” from registering the orders to tracking
production and employee performance.

The JS developer will work on a React/Node app and focus on a specific
function, such as registering orders or CRM.

The developer must perform UI, DB, and infrastructure-related routines to
ensure that his app advances weekly and has a clear deliverable in Production.

We heavily use Cursor and only consider people who want to work with coding
LLMs.  
If you are interested in learning more about LLM at work, itâ€™s an excellent
chance for you to join the team that develops many best practices around it.

The project is just started and is backed by one of the biggest names in the
dry-cleaning industry.

No legacy  
No bureaucracy  
No long meetings

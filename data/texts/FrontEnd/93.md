**Who are we, and what do we aspire to?**

Liven builds an ecosystem of products that help people understand themselves
better, manage their thoughts, and, as a result, feel better.

We believe that self-discovery is a lifelong journey and want to help people
navigate it every step of the way. That’s why Liven is building a system of
tools to help people compose themselves and grow into who they want to become.

People use Liven to track their mood, process emotions, and untangle thoughts
by chatting with an AI companion. They build new routines with a task planner,
explore how their brain and body react to trauma through personalized courses,
take well-being quizzes, and relax or refocus with soundscapes.

Our goal is to become the No.1 brand in the wellbeing category.

We aim to earn global trust by building an ecosystem of context-aware products
for self-care and improvement. Our brand is optimistic and whimsical, yet wise
and practical. We’re Liven! We bring joy back to life!

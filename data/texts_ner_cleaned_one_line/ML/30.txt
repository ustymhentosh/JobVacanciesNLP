Senior Full-Stack / Founding Tech Lead (AI CRM) About us:We’re building a modern, AI-first CRM for recruiting. True greenfield with rapid iterations and real ownership. Goal: MVP in ~60 days, harden for scale by Day 90. You’ll be the cornerstone engineering hire working directly with the founder.Why this role: Massive ownership: set the technical direction and standards from day one. Real product impact: ship AI features that recruiters use daily (search, summaries, matching, automations). Founding-level equity and a fast path to Head of Engineering / early CTO. What you’ll do: Own the architecture for a secure, multi-tenant SaaS, choosing a managed-first platform (e.g., Vercel/Cloudflare/Fly.io/Render or AWS/GCP/Azure) that balances speed, reliability, and cost for a small team. Build end-to-end: TypeScript/React app, APIs, data models, background jobs, and real-time features. Ship AI capabilities: RAG search, entity dedupe/matching, summarization, recommendations—designed with evals, guardrails, and cost/latency budgets. Establish engineering standards: testing, code conventions, CI/CD, feature flags, observability, RBAC, audit trails, data privacy (consent/DNC, export/delete). Collaborate & lead: translate product goals into technical plans and help hire/mentor 3–6 engineers as we scale. What you’ll need (skills & experience): 3++ years building and shipping SaaS with significant 0→1 ownership. Strong React + TypeScript and modern API design; comfortable with relational data modeling, transactions, and indexing. Practical LLM integration: embeddings/RAG, tool-calling/structured outputs, streaming UIs; you can weigh model quality vs. latency vs. cost. Background processing: designing idempotent jobs, retries, schedules, and event-driven workflows. Security & privacy mindset: role-based access, least privilege, auditability, and basic threat modeling. Product sense & communication: you can clarify scope, trade-offs, and deliver shippable increments quickly. Tooling you’ll actually use (illustrative, or equivalent) Web app & APIs: Next.js/React + TypeScript for UI and server routes; tRPC or REST/GraphQL for typed contracts. Data: Postgres (Neon/Supabase/Cloud SQL/Aurora) + Prisma ORM; pgvector for semantic search; Redis (Upstash/managed Valkey) for cache/queues; object storage (S3/R2). AI: OpenAI / Anthropic / Google (plus OSS where it fits) via Vercel AI SDK/direct SDKs; LangGraph/LangChain/OpenAI Assistants for agentic flows where appropriate. Prompt Ops & evals: Langfuse (prompt/version registry & tracing), Helicone/Promptfoo/RAGAS/DeepEval for quality & cost metrics. Background & orchestration: Inngest/Trigger.dev or Temporal; platform crons (Cloudflare/Vercel/EventBridge/Cloud Scheduler). Observability: OpenTelemetry traces + Sentry/Datadog/Grafana Cloud logs/dashboards. Delivery: GitHub Actions CI/CD, per-PR previews; GrowthBook/Unleash feature flags/A-B tests. Auth & enterprise: Auth.js/Clerk/Stytch for auth; WorkOS/Okta for SSO/SAML when needed. Comms integrations: Resend/Postmark/Mailgun (email), Twilio/MessageBird (SMS), Google/Microsoft Graph (calendar). AI-accelerated dev: Cursor, Claude, Copilot/Cody—used deliberately with human-in-the-loop reviews. Outcomes that define success (30 / 60 / 90)Day 30 Architecture doc + lightweight threat model with platform choice rationale. Monorepo scaffold (Turborepo/pnpm, Biome/lint) + CI (GitHub Actions). Auth/roles live; first UI flows (companies/contacts); seeded Postgres/Prisma. Baseline AI: embeddings pipeline + eval harness wired into Langfuse; initial traces and cost/latency dashboard.Day 60 (MVP) Usable CRM: companies, contacts, pipeline, notes/tasks, saved views/search. Email/SMS I/O and unified activity timeline; background jobs running in prod. AI V1: RAG search, dedupe/matching, meeting/email summaries; eval dashboards and budget guards.Day 90 Hardening: SLOs/alerts, audit logging, DR/backups (PITR), performance pass. First automations (auto-enrich → routing/sequences). Prompt versioning & A/Bs, red-team tests (injection/PII), model fallback/traffic splitting. Nice to have CRM/ERP domain; deliverability and calendar integrations; analytics (PostHog/Segment). SOC2/GDPR exposure; incident response basics. Team-lead experience (mentoring, hiring loop, leveling). Compensation & equity Competitive salary + 5–10% founding-level equity Milestone bonuses tied to Day-60/90 deliverables. Change-of-control protection and refreshers at next financing.How we work Small, senior, high-trust team; short cycles, small diffs, preview-before-merge. AI-accelerated dev, measured by quality, safety, and cost—not just speed. Security by default and data privacy from day one.Process: Intro chat → Systems/product deep-dive → Practical pairing or time-boxed take- home (≤3 hours) → Founder loop → Offer.Apply: Send GitHub/portfolio/LinkedIn and a short note on a 0→1 or LLM-powered feature you shipped (what changed and why) to [[email protected]](/cdn- cgi/l/email- protection#e28983968a8e87878ca28786958390868883818d809190878190978b968f878c96cc818d8fcc8397) with Subject: Founding Full-Stack (AI CRM)

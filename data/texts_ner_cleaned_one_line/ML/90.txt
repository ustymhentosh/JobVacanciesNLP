AI Engineer (LangChain / RAG / TypeScript) About UsCareerSwift is an AI-powered career automation platform helping job seekers land their dream roles faster through smart resume building, LinkedIn optimization, interview practice, and now — an agentic infrastructure built on top of LLMs.We’re expanding our stack beyond the Vercel AI SDK and are looking for someone who deeply understands LangChain, vector databases, and production-level RAG systems to help us scale faster and smarter.What You’ll Work On Lead the migration of our AI layer from Vercel AI SDK to LangChain (TypeScript). Design and implement agentic workflows that handle resume optimization, job matching, and auto-apply pipelines. Build scalable RAG systems for user-specific retrieval and knowledge augmentation. Integrate Convex or alternative vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate) for efficient embeddings search. Optimize LLM performance and cost-efficiency , and ensure smooth multi-model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). Collaborate with the core engineering team on Next.js 15 / Vercel / Convex stack. Optionally, experiment with LangSmith, MCP, and agent orchestration for real-time decision-making.What We’re Looking For 3+ years of experience in software engineering (preferably backend or AI systems). Strong proficiency in TypeScript / Node.js / Next.js. Proven experience with LangChain, RAG, or vector DBs in production. Understanding of LLM orchestration, embeddings, and agentic architecture. Familiarity with OpenAI API, Vercel AI SDK, or similar frameworks. Ability to architect and optimize pipelines for real-world use cases. Self-driven, startup-minded, and able to work asynchronously in a small distributed team.Tech Stack You’ll Touch`Next.js 15` · `TypeScript` · `LangChain` · `Convex` · `Vercel AI SDK` · `OpenAI API` · `PostHog` · `Stripe` · `Vector Databases (Pinecone / Qdrant)`Bonus Points Experience with LangSmith or LangServe.

You’ll work hands-on with large language models, vector search, and prompt engineering — and extend beyond text modality by integrating vision and speech models. From knowledge aggregation across multiple sources — unifying text, images, and audio into coherent outputs — to agentic systems that can plan, reason, and act on data, your focus will be on combining, tuning, and deploying existing AI solutions into robust, production-ready systems. You’ll be joining an R&D team that brings together experts across product, DevOps, software engineering and AI research.Responsibilities: Drive R&D multiple projects from design to deployment in an iterative improvement cycle. Build rapid prototypes, validate hypotheses and integrate AI blocks into user-focused applications and data pipelines. Design and implement LLM-based features to solve real-world problems, including document understanding, content summarization, and interactive Q&A. Develop agentic AI workflows that combine reasoning, tool calling, memory management and context engineering to automate complex tasks. Leverage RAG, vector databases, chunking techniques, and hybrid search methods to efficiently manage context and information retrieval. Integrate monitoring and evaluation best practices to track AI model performance and control costs, ensuring system observability to detect and address possible issues. Incorporate vision and speech capabilities to extend AI solutions beyond text in multimodal tasks. Fine-tune and adapt pre-trained models to meet specific project needs. Collaborate closely within a team to bring AI solutions to production.Requirements: Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field.Experience: 3+ years in AI engineering with a strong portfolio of real-world projects. Strong hands-on experience with LLMs including, prompt engineering, RAG implementations, AI agents, evaluation, observability, fine-tuning pre-trained models, 3rd party hosted providers and local LLMs. Experience with other DL/ML tasks in vision and speech modalities for classification, generation, document understanding and transcription.Technical Skills: Proficient in Python and relevant AI frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK, Hugging Face Transformers). VCS (GitHub, GitLab). Cloud: development and deployment experience on AWS, GCP, or Azure. Deployment skills for AI services via APIs or batch workflows, including containerization with Docker.Soft Skills: Excellent problem-solving skills. Commitment to continuous learning, staying up-to-date with state-of-the-art research, following leading AI researchers, and exploring emerging tools and techniques. Team-oriented with collaborative mindset. Strong communication and presentation skills to explain complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

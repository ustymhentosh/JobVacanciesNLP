AI/ML Engineer (LLM & Autonomous Systems Specialist) We are looking for an AI/ML Engineer (LLM and Autonomous Systems Specialist) to help us deliver an ambitious new project — the development and training of intelligent behavioral models for autonomous platforms capable of operating and making decisions without constant network connectivity.The project lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, simulation, and robotics.Its goal is to create a system where AI not only reacts but also understands context and adapts to its environment.We are a technology-driven FinTech company that has gone far beyond traditional financial services — actively expanding R&D directions related to autonomous systems, model training, and next-generation agent architectures.If you’re ready to build technologies at the intersection of AI, machine learning, and autonomous systems — welcome to the team!Responsibilities: Train AI models that analyze sensor data and make autonomous decisions (Behavioral Cloning, Reinforcement Learning). Work with virtual simulation environments that create scenarios for reinforcement learning. Configure and optimize algorithms for computer vision and navigation — obstacle detection, route planning, spatial orientation. Transfer trained models from simulation to real devices and adapt them to limited hardware resources. Develop and test behavioral strategies for operation under weak or no connectivity.Requirements: Strong experience with Python, PyTorch, and/or TensorFlow. Deep understanding of CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and LLM fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, PEFT). Experience with LLM serving frameworks such as vLLM, Ollama. Simulation & Training: The AI model is initially trained in a virtual environment using cloud platforms. Computing Power: A separate high-performance computer.Nice to have: Work with simulation environments (AirSim, CARLA, Isaac Sim) for synthetic data generation and model validation. Data Handling: MongoDB is used as a local onboard database to store instructions and sensor data. Hardware Integration: A Raspberry Pi acts as the intermediary, receiving AI commands and relaying them to the controller (e.g., Jetson, Pixhawk).What We Offer: Competitive salary and performance-based bonuses. Opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI + blockchain projects. Flexible working hours and remote work options. Professional development, training, and access to AI & blockchain research resources. A collaborative and innovative work environment.Join us and help shape the future of AI-driven blockchain automation!
